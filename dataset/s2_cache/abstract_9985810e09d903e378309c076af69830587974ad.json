{"abstract":"Significant progress has been witnessed in learning-based Multi-view Stereo (MVS) under supervised and unsupervised settings. To combine their respective merits in accuracy and completeness, meantime reducing the demand for expensive labeled data, this paper explores the problem of learning-based MVS in a semi-supervised setting that only a tiny part of the MVS data is attached with dense depth ground truth. However, due to huge variation of scenarios and flexible settings in views, it may break the basic assumption in classic semi-supervised learning, that unlabeled data and labeled data share the same label space and data distribution, named as semi-supervised distribution-gap ambiguity in the MVS problem. To handle these issues, we propose a novel semi-supervised distribution-augmented MVS framework, namely SDA-MVS. For the simple case that the basic assumption works in MVS data, consistency regularization encourages the model predictions to be consistent between original sample and randomly augmented sample. For further troublesome case that the basic assumption is conflicted in MVS data, we propose a novel style consistency loss to alleviate the negative effect caused by the distribution gap. The visual style of unlabeled sample is transferred to labeled sample to shrink the gap, and the model prediction of generated sample is further supervised with the label in original labeled sample. The experimental results in semi-supervised settings of multiple MVS datasets show the superior performance of the proposed method. With the same settings in backbone network, our proposed SDA-MVS outperforms its fully-supervised and unsupervised baselines."}
