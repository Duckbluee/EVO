{"abstract":"Large Multimodal Model (LMM) GPT-4V(ision) endows GPT-4 with visual grounding capabilities, making it possible to handle certain tasks through the Visual Question Answering (VQA) paradigm. This paper explores the potential of VQA-oriented GPT-4V in the recently popular visual Anomaly Detection (AD) and is the first to conduct qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the popular MVTec AD and VisA datasets. Considering that this task requires both image-/pixel-level evaluations, the proposed GPT-4V-AD framework contains three components: \\textbf{\\textit{1)}} Granular Region Division, \\textbf{\\textit{2)}} Prompt Designing, \\textbf{\\textit{3)}} Text2Segmentation for easy quantitative evaluation, and have made some different attempts for comparative analysis. The results show that GPT-4V can achieve certain results in the zero-shot AD task through a VQA paradigm, such as achieving image-level 77.1/88.0 and pixel-level 68.0/76.6 AU-ROCs on MVTec AD and VisA datasets, respectively. However, its performance still has a certain gap compared to the state-of-the-art zero-shot method, \\eg, WinCLIP and CLIP-AD, and further researches are needed. This study provides a baseline reference for the research of VQA-oriented LMM in the zero-shot AD task, and we also post several possible future works.
