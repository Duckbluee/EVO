{"abstract":"The Sundanese language has over 32 million speakers worldwide, but the language has reaped little to no benefits from the recent advances in natural language understanding. Like other low-resource languages, the only alternative is to fine-tune existing multilingual models. In this paper, we pre-trained three monolingual Transformer-based language models on Sundanese data. When evaluated on a downstream text classification task, we found that most of our monolingual models outperformed larger multilingual models despite the smaller overall pre-training data. In the subsequent analyses, our models benefited strongly from the Sundanese pre-training corpus size and do not exhibit socially biased behavior. We released our models for other researchers and practitioners to use."}
