{"abstract":"The rapid advancement of video generation models has made it increasingly challenging to distinguish AI-generated videos from real ones. This issue underscores the urgent need for effective AI-generated video detectors to prevent the dissemination of false information via such videos. However, the development of high-performance AI-generated video detectors is currently impeded by the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets specifically designed for generative video detection. To this end, we introduce GenVidBench, a challenging AI-generated video detection dataset with several key advantages: 1) Large-scale video collection: The dataset contains 6.78 million videos and is currently the largest dataset for AI-generated video detection. 2) Cross-Source and Cross-Generator: The cross-source generation reduces the interference of video content on the detection. The cross-generator ensures diversity in video attributes between the training and test sets, preventing them from being overly similar. 3) State-of-the-Art Video Generators: The dataset includes videos from 11 state-of-the-art AI video generators, ensuring that it covers the latest advancements in the field of video generation. These generators ensure that the datasets are not only large in scale but also diverse, aiding in the development of generalized and effective detection models. Additionally, we present extensive experimental results with advanced video classification models. With GenVidBench, researchers can efficiently develop and evaluate AI-generated video detection models.. Datasets and code are available at https://genvidbench.github.io."}
