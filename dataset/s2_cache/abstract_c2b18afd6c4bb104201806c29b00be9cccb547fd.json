{"abstract":"Point cloud super-resolution is a fundamental problem for 3D reconstruction and 3D data understanding. It takes a low-resolution (LR) point cloud as input and generates a high-resolution (HR) point cloud with rich details. In this paper, we present a data-driven method for point cloud super-resolution based on graph networks and adversarial losses. The key idea of the proposed network is to exploit the local similarity of point cloud and the analogy between LR input and HR output. For the former, we design a deep network with graph convolution. For the latter, we propose to add residual connections into graph convolution and introduce a skip connection between input and output. The proposed network is trained with a novel loss function, which combines Chamfer Distance (CD) and graph adversarial loss. Such a loss function captures the characteristics of HR point cloud automatically without manual design. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate our method and validate the superiority over other methods. Results show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance and have a good generalization ability to unseen data."}
