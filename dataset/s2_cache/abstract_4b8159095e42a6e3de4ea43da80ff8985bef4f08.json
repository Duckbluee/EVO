{"abstract":"Traditional supervised learning methods require large quantities of labeled data. However, labeling sleep data according to polysomnography by well-trained sleep experts is a very tedious job. In the present day, the development of self-supervised learning methods is making significant progress in many fields. It is also possible to apply some of these methods to sleep staging. This is to remove the dependency on labeled data at the stage of representation extraction. Nevertheless, they often rely too much on negative samples for sample selection and construction. Therefore, we propose PSNSleep, a novel self-supervised learning method for sleep staging based on Siamese networks. The crucial step to the success of our method is to select appropriate data augmentations (the time shift block) to construct the positive sample pair. PSNSleep achieves satisfactory results without relying on any negative samples. We evaluate PSNSleep on Sleep-EDF and ISRUC-Sleep and achieve accuracy of 80.0% and 74.4%.
