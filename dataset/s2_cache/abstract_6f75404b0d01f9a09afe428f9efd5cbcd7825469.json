{"abstract":"It has been demonstrated that the art of prompt tuning is highly effective in efficiently extracting knowledge from pretrained foundation models, encompassing pretrained language models (PLMs), vision pretrained models, and vision-language (V-L) models. However, the efficacy of employing fixed soft prompts with a predetermined position for concatenation with inputs for all instances, irrespective of their inherent disparities, remains uncertain. Variables such as the position, length, and representations of prompts across diverse instances and tasks can substantially influence the performance of prompt tuning. In this context, we provide a theoretical analysis, which reveals that optimizing the position of the prompt to encompass the input can capture additional semantic information that traditional prefix or postfix prompt tuning methods fail to capture. Building upon our analysis, we present a unified dynamic prompt (DP) tuning strategy that dynamically determines different factors of prompts based on specific tasks and instances. To accomplish this, we employ a lightweight learning network with Gumble-Softmax, allowing us to learn instance-dependent guidance. Experimental results underscore the significant performance improvement achieved by dynamic prompt tuning across a wide range of tasks, including NLP tasks, vision recognition tasks, and vision-language tasks. Furthermore, we establish the universal applicability of our approach under full-data, few-shot, and multitask scenarios. Codes are available at https://github.com/Xianjun-Yang/DPT."}
