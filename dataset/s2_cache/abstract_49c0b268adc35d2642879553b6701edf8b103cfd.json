{"abstract":"Noisy labels, resulting from mistakes in manual labeling or webly data collecting for supervised learning, can cause neural networks to overfit the misleading information and degrade the generalization performance. Self-supervised learning works in the absence of labels and thus eliminates the negative impact of noisy labels. Motivated by co-training with both supervised learning view and self-supervised learning view, we propose a simple yet effective method called Co-learning for learning with noisy labels. Co-learning performs supervised learning and self-supervised learning in a cooperative way. The constraints of intrinsic similarity with the self-supervised module and the structural similarity with the noisily-supervised module are imposed on a shared common feature encoder to regularize the network to maximize the agreement between the two constraints. Co-learning is compared with peer methods on corrupted data from benchmark datasets fairly, and extensive results are provided which demonstrate that Co-learning is superior to many state-of-the-art approaches."}
