{"abstract":"\n Given a stream of graph edges from a dynamic graph, how can we assign anomaly scores to edges in an online manner, for the purpose of detecting unusual behavior, using constant time and memory? Existing approaches aim to detect\n individually surprising\n edges.\n \n \n In this work, we propose\n Midas\n , which focuses on detecting\n microcluster anomalies\n , or suddenly arriving groups of suspiciously similar edges, such as lockstep behavior, including denial of service attacks in network traffic data. We further propose\n Midas\n -F, to solve the problem by which anomalies are incorporated into the algorithm’s internal states, creating a “poisoning” effect that can allow future anomalies to slip through undetected.\n Midas\n -F introduces two modifications: (1) we modify the anomaly scoring function, aiming to reduce the “poisoning” effect of newly arriving edges; (2) we introduce a conditional merge step, which updates the algorithm’s data structures after each time tick, but only if the anomaly score is below a threshold value, also to reduce the “poisoning” effect. Experiments show that\n Midas\n -F has significantly higher accuracy than\n Midas\n .\n \n In general, the algorithms proposed in this work have the following properties: (a) they detects microcluster anomalies while providing theoretical guarantees about the false positive probability; (b) they are online, thus processing each edge in constant time and constant memory, and also processes the data orders-of-magnitude faster than state-of-the-art approaches; and (c) they provides up to 62% higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve than state-of-the-art approaches."}
