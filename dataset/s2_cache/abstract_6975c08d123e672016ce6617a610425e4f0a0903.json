{"abstract":"This paper presents a novel approach to sentiment analysis specifically customized for predicting stock market movements, bypassing the need for external dictionaries that are often unavailable for many languages. Our methodology directly analyzes textual data, with a particular focus on context-specific sentiment words within neural network models. This specificity ensures that our sentiment analysis is both relevant and accurate in identifying trends in the stock market. We employ sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to enhance both the precision and interpretability of our models. Through meticulous data handling and advanced machine learning methods, we leverage large datasets from Twitter and financial markets to examine the impact of social media sentiment on financial trends. We achieved an accuracy exceeding 75%, highlighting the effectiveness of our modeling approach, which we further refined into a convolutional neural network model. This achievement contributes valuable insights into sentiment analysis within the financial domain, thereby improving the overall clarity of forecasting in this field."}
