{"abstract":"Diffusion models have shown promising results on single-image super-resolution and other image- to-image translation tasks. Despite this success, they have not outperformed state-of-the-art GAN models on the more challenging blind super-resolution task, where the input images are out of distribution, with unknown degradations. This paper introduces SR3+, a diffusion-based model for blind super-resolution, establishing a new state-of-the-art. To this end, we advocate self-supervised training with a combination of composite, parameterized degradations for self-supervised training, and noise-conditioing augmentation during training and testing. With these innovations, a large-scale convolutional architecture, and large-scale datasets, SR3+ greatly outperforms SR3. It outperforms Real-ESRGAN when trained on the same data, with a DRealSR FID score of 36.82 vs. 37.22, which further improves to FID of 32.37 with larger models, and further still with larger training sets."}
