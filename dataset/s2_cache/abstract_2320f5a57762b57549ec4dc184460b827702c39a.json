{"abstract":"Pooling operations have shown to be effective on computer vision and natural language processing tasks. One challenge of performing pooling operations on graph data is the lack of locality that is not well-defined on graphs. Previous studies used global ranking methods to sample some of the important nodes, but most of them are not able to incorporate graph topology. In this work, we propose the topology-aware pooling (TAP) layer that explicitly considers graph topology. Our TAP layer is a two-stage voting process that selects more important nodes in a graph. It first performs local voting to generate scores for each node by attending each node to its neighboring nodes. The scores are generated locally such that topology information is explicitly considered. In addition, graph topology is incorporated in global voting to compute the importance score of each node globally in the entire graph. Altogether, the final ranking score for each node is computed by combining its local and global voting scores. To encourage better graph connectivity in the sampled graph, we propose to add a graph connectivity term to the computation of ranking scores. Results on graph classification tasks demonstrate that our methods achieve consistently better performance than previous methods."}
