{"abstract":"Electric vehicles (EVs) have been adopted in urban areas to reduce environmental pollution and global warming as a result of the increasing number of freight vehicles. However, there are still deficiencies in routing the trajectories of last-mile logistics that continue to impact social and economic sustainability. For that reason, in this paper, a hyper-heuristic (HH) approach called Hyper-heuristic Adaptive Simulated Annealing with Reinforcement Learning (HHASA$_{RL}$) is proposed. It is composed of a multi-armed bandit method and the self-adaptive Simulated Annealing (SA) metaheuristic algorithm for solving the problem called Capacitated Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (CEVRP). Due to the limited number of charging stations and the travel range of EVs, the EVs must require battery recharging moments in advance and reduce travel times and costs. The HH implemented improves multiple minimum best-known solutions and obtains the best mean values for some high-dimensional instances for the proposed benchmark for the IEEE WCCI2020 competition."}
