{"abstract":"In recent years, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have played a crucial role in the development of advanced knowledge-intensive applications, such as recommender systems and semantic search. However, the human sensory system is inherently multi-modal, as objects around us are often represented by a combination of multiple signals, such as visual and textual. Consequently, Multi-modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), which combine structured knowledge representation with multiple modalities, represent a powerful extension of KGs. Although MMKGs can handle certain types of tasks (e.g., visual query answering) or queries that standard KGs cannot process, and they can effectively tackle some standard problems (e.g., entity alignment), we lack a widely accepted definition of MMKG. In this survey, we provide a rigorous definition of MMKGs along with a classification scheme based on how existing approaches address four fundamental challenges: representation, fusion, alignment, and translation, which are crucial to improving an MMKG. Our classification scheme is flexible and allows for easy incorporation of new approaches, as well as a comparison of two approaches in terms of how they address one of the fundamental challenges mentioned above. As the first comprehensive survey of MMKG, this article aims at inspiring and provide a reference for relevant researchers in the field of Artificial Intelligence."}
