{"abstract":"Since the emergence of security concerns in artificial intelligence (AI), there has been significant attention devoted to the examination of backdoor attacks. Attackers can utilize backdoor attacks to manipulate model predictions, leading to significant potential harm. However, current research on backdoor attacks and defenses in both theoretical and practical fields still has many shortcomings. To systematically analyze these shortcomings and address the lack of comprehensive reviews, this article presents a comprehensive and systematic summary of both backdoor attacks and defenses targeting multi-domain AI models. Simultaneously, based on the design principles and shared characteristics of triggers in different domains and the implementation stages of backdoor defense, this article proposes a new classification method for backdoor attacks and defenses. We use this method to extensively review backdoor attacks in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, and we also examine the current applications of backdoor attacks in audio recognition, video action recognition, multimodal tasks, time series tasks, generative learning, and reinforcement learning, while critically analyzing the open problems of various backdoor attack techniques and defense strategies. Finally, this article builds upon the analysis of the current state of AI security to further explore potential future research directions for backdoor attacks and defenses."}
