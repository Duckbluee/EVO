{"abstract":"Deepfakes are on the rise, with increased sophistication and prevalence allowing for high-profile social engineering attacks. Detecting them in the wild is therefore important as ever, giving rise to new approaches breaking benchmark records in this task. In line with previous work, we show that recently developed state-of-the-art detectors are susceptible to classical adversarial attacks, even in a highly-realistic black-box setting, putting their usability in question. We argue that crucial 'robust features' of deepfakes are in their higher semantics, and follow that with evidence that a detector based on a semantic embedding model is less susceptible to black-box perturbation attacks. We show that large visuo-lingual models like GPT-4o can perform zero-shot deepfake detection better than current state-of-the-art methods, and introduce a novel attack based on high-level semantic manipulation. Finally, we argue that hybridising low- and high-level detectors can improve adversarial robustness, based on their complementary strengths and weaknesses."}
