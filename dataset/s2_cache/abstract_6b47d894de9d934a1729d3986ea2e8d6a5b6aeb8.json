{"abstract":"The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is considered to be one of the most promising revolutionary technologies to increase productivity. With the refined development of manufacturing, the entire manufacturing process is split up into several areas of IoT production. Devices from different domains cooperate to perform the same task, which cause security problems in interacted communication among them. Existing authentication methods cause heavy key management overhead or rely on a trusted third party. It is imperative to protect privacy and ensure the credibility of the device during device interaction. This article proposes a federated hierarchical trust interaction scheme (FHTI) for the cross-domain industrial IoT. It builds a low-privacy network platform through blockchain and protects the data privacy of the IIoT. A hierarchical trust mechanism based on federated detection is designed to realize the unified trust evaluation of cross-domain devices. A trusted cross-domain method based on device trust value is designed to ensure the security and trustworthiness of cross-domain devices. The simulation results show that the FHTI scheme can improve the speed of identity authentication and the detection accuracy of malicious devices."}
