{"abstract":"Knowledge Graph (KG) embedding approaches have been proved effective to infer new facts for a KG based on the existing ones–a problem known as KG completion. However, most of them have focused on static KGs, in fact, relational facts in KGs often show temporal dynamics, e.g., the fact (US, has president, Barack Obama, [2009–2017]) is only valid from 2009 to 2017. Therefore, utilizing available time information to develop temporal KG embedding models is an increasingly important problem. In this paper, we propose a new hyperplane-based time-aware KG embedding model for temporal KG completion. By employing the method of time-specific hyperplanes, our model could explicitly incorporate time information in the entity-relation space to predict missing elements in the KG more effectively, especially temporal scopes for facts with missing time information. Moreover, in order to model and infer four important relation patterns including symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion and composition, we map facts happened at the same time into a polar coordinate system. During training procedure, a time-enhanced negative sampling strategy is proposed to get more effective negative samples. Experimental results on datasets extracted from real-world temporal KGs show that our model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches for the KG completion task."}
