{"abstract":"Past work demonstrated that using neural networks, we can extend unfinished music pieces while maintaining the music style of the musician. With recent advancements in large language models and diffusion models, we are now capable of generating comics with an interesting storyline while maintaining the art style of the artist. In this paper, we used ChatGPT to generate storylines and dialogue and then generated the comic using stable diffusion. We introduced a novel way to evaluate AI-generated stories, and we achieved SOTA performance on character fidelity and art style by fine-tuning stable diffusion using LoRA, ControlNet, etc."}
