{"abstract":"In this paper, we empirically investigate the effect of audio preprocessing on music tagging with deep neural networks. We perform comprehensive experiments involving audio preprocessing using different time-frequency representations, logarithmic magnitude compression, frequency weighting, and scaling. We show that many commonly used input preprocessing techniques are redundant except magnitude compression."}
