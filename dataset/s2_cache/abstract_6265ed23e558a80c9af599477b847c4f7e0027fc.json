{"abstract":"We propose a spherical kernel for efficient graph convolution of 3D point clouds. Our metric-based kernels systematically quantize the local 3D space to identify distinctive geometric relationships in the data. Similar to the regular grid CNN kernels, the spherical kernel maintains translation-invariance and asymmetry properties, where the former guarantees weight sharing among similar local structures in the data and the latter facilitates fine geometric learning. The proposed kernel is applied to graph neural networks without edge-dependent filter generation, making it computationally attractive for large point clouds. In our graph networks, each vertex is associated with a single point location and edges connect the neighborhood points within a defined range. The graph gets coarsened in the network with farthest point sampling. Analogous to the standard CNNs, we define pooling and unpooling operations for our network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed spherical kernel with graph neural networks for point cloud classification and semantic segmentation using ModelNet, ShapeNet, RueMonge2014, ScanNet and S3DIS datasets.
