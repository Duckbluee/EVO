{"abstract":"In this paper, a fault tolerant continuous time consensus algorithm is proposed for nonlinearly networked multi-agent systems. The proposed light-weight algorithm is novel in the sense that it solves the continuous time nonlinear consensus problem in the presence of Byzantine agents while removing minimal useful information. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the success of the proposed algorithm are presented for fixed topologies. Then, the results are extended for time-varying networks. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the theoretical results."}
