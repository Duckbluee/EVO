{"abstract":"For understanding the structure of the resulting graphs and for analyzing the behavior of network algorithms, the next question is bounding the size of the diameter. The only known bound is $$\\mathcal {O}\\log n^{32/3-\\beta 5-\\beta }$$ Kiwi and Mitsche. ANALCO, pp. 26---39, 2015. We present two much simpler proofs for an improved upper bound of $$\\mathcal {O}\\log n^{2/3-\\beta }$$ and a lower bound of $$\\Omega \\log n$$. If the average degree is bounded from above by some constant, we show that the latter bound is tight by proving an upper bound of $$\\mathcal {O}\\log n$$ for the diameter."}
