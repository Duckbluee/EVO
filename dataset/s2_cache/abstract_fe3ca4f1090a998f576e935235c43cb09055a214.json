{"abstract":"This paper proposes an unsupervised feature learning approach on industrial time series data for detection of valve stiction. Considering the commonly existed characteristics of industrial time series signals and the condition that sometimes massive reliable labeled-data are not available, a new time series data transformation and augmentation method is developed. The transformation stage converts the raw time series signals to 2-D matrices and the augmentation stage increases the diversity of the matrices by performing transformation on different timescales. Then a convolutional autoencoder is used to extract the representative features on the augmented data, these new features are taken as the inputs of the traditional clustering algorithms. Unlike the traditional approaches using hand-crafted features or requiring labeled-data, the proposed strategy can automatically learn features on the time series data collected from industrial control loops without supervision. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated through the International Stiction Data Base (ISDB). Compared with the traditional machine learning methods and deep learning based methods, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms the other methods. Besides performance evaluation, we provide a visualization process of feature learning via principal component analysis."}
