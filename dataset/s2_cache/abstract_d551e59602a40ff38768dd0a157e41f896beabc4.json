{"abstract":"This paper addresses novel consensus problems for multi-agent systems operating in an unreliable environment where adversaries are spreading. The dynamics of the adversarial spreading processes follows the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, where the infection induces faulty behaviors in the agents and affects their state values. Such a problem setting serves as a model of opinion dynamics in social networks where consensus is to be formed at the time of pandemic and infected individuals may deviate from their true opinions. To ensure resilient consensus among the noninfectious agents, the difficulty is that the number of infectious agents changes over time. We assume that a local policy maker announces the local level of infection in real-time, which can be adopted by the agent for its preventative measures. It is demonstrated that this problem can be formulated as resilient consensus in the presence of the socalled mobile malicious models, where the mean subsequence reduced (MSR) algorithms are known to be effective. We characterize sufficient conditions on the network structures for different policies regarding the announced infection levels and the strength of the epidemic. Numerical simulations are carried out for random graphs to verify the effectiveness of our approach."}
