{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE\nBrief hospital course (BHC) summaries are clinical documents that summarize a patient's hospital stay. While large language models (LLMs) depict remarkable capabilities in automating real-world tasks, their capabilities for healthcare applications such as synthesizing BHCs from clinical notes have not been shown. We introduce a novel preprocessed dataset, the MIMIC-IV-BHC, encapsulating clinical note and BHC pairs to adapt LLMs for BHC synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a benchmark of the summarization performance of 2 general-purpose LLMs and 3 healthcare-adapted LLMs.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nUsing clinical notes as input, we apply prompting-based (using in-context learning) and fine-tuning-based adaptation strategies to 3 open-source LLMs (Clinical-T5-Large, Llama2-13B, and FLAN-UL2) and 2 proprietary LLMs (Generative Pre-trained Transformer [GPT]-3.5 and GPT-4). We evaluate these LLMs across multiple context-length inputs using natural language similarity metrics. We further conduct a clinical study with 5 clinicians, comparing clinician-written and LLM-generated BHCs across 30 samples, focusing on their potential to enhance clinical decision-making through improved summary quality. We compare reader preferences for the original and LLM-generated summary using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. We further request optional qualitative feedback from clinicians to gain deeper insights into their preferences, and we present the frequency of common themes arising from these comments.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe Llama2-13B fine-tuned LLM outperforms other domain-adapted models given quantitative evaluation metrics of Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-Score. GPT-4 with in-context learning shows more robustness to increasing context lengths of clinical note inputs than fine-tuned Llama2-13B. Despite comparable quantitative metrics, the reader study depicts a significant preference for summaries generated by GPT-4 with in-context learning compared to both Llama2-13B fine-tuned summaries and the original summaries (P<.001), highlighting the need for qualitative clinical evaluation.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\nWe release a foundational clinically relevant dataset, the MIMIC-IV-BHC, and present an open-source benchmark of LLM performance in BHC synthesis from clinical notes. We observe high-quality summarization performance for both in-context proprietary and fine-tuned open-source LLMs using both quantitative metrics and a qualitative clinical reader study. Our research effectively integrates elements from the data assimilation pipeline: our methods use (1) clinical data sources to integrate, (2) data translation, and (3) knowledge creation, while our evaluation strategy paves the way for (4) deployment."}
