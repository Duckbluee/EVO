{"abstract":"Generating human-like behavior on robots is a great challenge especially in dexterous manipulation tasks with robotic hands. Scripting policies from scratch is intractable due to the high-dimensional control space, and training policies with reinforcement learning (RL) and manual reward engineering can also be hard and lead to unnatural motions. Leveraging the recent progress on RL from Human Feedback, we propose a framework that learns a universal human prior using direct human preference feedback over videos, for efficiently tuning the RL policies on 20 dual-hand robot manipulation tasks in simulation, without a single human demonstration. A task-agnostic reward model is trained through iteratively generating diverse polices and collecting human preference over the trajectories; it is then applied for regularizing the behavior of polices in the fine-tuning stage. Our method empirically demonstrates more human-like behaviors on robot hands in diverse tasks including even unseen tasks, indicating its generalization capability."}
