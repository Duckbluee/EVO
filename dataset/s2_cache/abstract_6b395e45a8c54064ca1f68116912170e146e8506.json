{"abstract":"The powerful large language models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in advancing recommender systems. Recently, in both academia and industry, there has been a surge of interest in developing LLMs for recommendation, referred to as LLM4Rec. This includes endeavors like leveraging LLMs for generative item retrieval and ranking, as well as the exciting possibility of building universal LLMs for diverse open-ended recommendation tasks. These developments hold the potential to reshape the traditional recommender paradigm, paving the way for the next-generation recommender systems. In this tutorial, we aim to retrospect the evolution of LLM4Rec and conduct a comprehensive review of existing research. In particular, we will clarify how recommender systems benefit from LLMs through a variety of perspectives, including the model architecture, learning paradigm, and the strong abilities of LLMs such as chatting, generalization, planning, and generation. Furthermore, we will discuss the critical challenges and open problems in this emerging field, for instance, the trustworthiness, efficiency, and model retraining issues. Lastly, we will summarize the implications of previous work and outline future research directions. We believe that this tutorial will assist the audience in better understanding the progress and prospects of LLM4Rec, inspiring them for future exploration. This, in turn, will drive the prosperity of LLM4Rec, possibly fostering a paradigm shift in recommendation systems."}
