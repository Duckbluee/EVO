{"abstract":"Traffic flow prediction is one of the key research directions of intelligent transportation systems, and accurate traffic flow prediction can effectively reduce traffic congestion and improve road utilization. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, many machine learning and deep learning models have been successfully applied to traffic flow prediction. Due to the many factors influencing traffic flow, the extremely complex nonlinear relationships between these factors, and the complex temporal and spatial correlations of traffic flow, traffic flow prediction is considered a challenging problem. In this paper, a new Multi-Spatial-Temporal Encoder-Decoder Model (MST-EDM) based on Transformer is proposed to capture the temporal correlation of traffic flow more accurately. Weekly time series encoder block, daily time series encoder block and adjacent time series encoder block are used to extract weekly time series correlation, daily time series correlation and adjacent time series correlation. The temporal correlation of different time slices is fused by feature. Experiments were conducted using the PEMS04 highway datasets from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System. The results show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines."}
