{"abstract":"Text-to-image models suffer from various safety issues that may limit their suitability for deployment. Previous methods have separately addressed individual issues of bias, copyright, and offensive content in text-to-image models. However, in the real world, all of these issues appear simultaneously in the same model. We present a method that tackles all issues with a single approach. Our method, Unified Concept Editing (UCE), edits the model without training using a closed-form solution, and scales seamlessly to concurrent edits on text-conditional diffusion models.We present scalable simultaneous debiasing, style erasure, and content moderation by editing text-to-image projections, and perform extensive experiments demonstrating improved efficacy and scalability over prior work. Our code is available at unified.baulab.info."}
