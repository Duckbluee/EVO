{"abstract":"Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are useful tools for visualizing the hypothesized causal structures in an intuitive way and selecting relevant confounders in causal inference. However, in spite of their increasing use in clinical and surgical research, the causal graphs might also be misused by a lack of understanding of the central principles. In this article, we aim to introduce the basic terminology and fundamental rules of DAGs, and DAGitty, a user-friendly program that easily displays DAGs. Specifically, we describe how to determine variables that should or should not be adjusted based on the backdoor criterion with examples. In addition, the occurrence of the various types of biases is discussed with caveats, including the problem caused by the traditional approach using p-values for confounder selection. Moreover, a detailed guide to DAGitty is provided with practical examples regarding minimally invasive surgery. Essentially, the primary benefit of DAGs is to aid researchers in clarifying the research questions and the corresponding designs based on the domain knowledge. With these strengths, we propose that the use of DAGs may contribute to rigorous research designs, and lead to transparency and reproducibility in research on minimally invasive surgery."}
