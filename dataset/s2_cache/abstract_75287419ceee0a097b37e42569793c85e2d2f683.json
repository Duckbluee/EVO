{"abstract":"Deep learning (DL) based semantic communication methods have been explored to transmit images efficiently in recent years. In this paper, we propose a generative model based semantic communication to further improve the efficiency of image transmission and protect private information. In particular, the transmitter extracts the interpretable latent representation from the original image by a generative model exploiting the GAN inversion method. We also employ a privacy filter and a knowledge base to erase private information and replace it with natural features in the knowledge base. The simulation results indicate that our proposed method achieves comparable quality of received images while significantly reducing communication costs compared to the existing methods."}
