{"abstract":"Abstract In many different classification tasks it is required to manage structured data, which are usually modeled as graphs. Moreover, these graphs can be dynamic, meaning that the vertices/edges of each graph may change over time. The goal is to exploit existing neural network architectures to model datasets that are best represented with graph structures that change over time. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this task has not been addressed using these kinds of architectures. Two novel approaches are proposed, which combine Long Short-Term Memory networks and Graph Convolutional Networks to learn long short-term dependencies together with graph structure. The advantage provided by the proposed methods is confirmed by the results achieved on four real world datasets: an increase of up to 12 percentage points in Accuracy and F1 scores for vertex-based semi-supervised classification and up to 2 percentage points in Accuracy and F1 scores for graph-based supervised classification."}
