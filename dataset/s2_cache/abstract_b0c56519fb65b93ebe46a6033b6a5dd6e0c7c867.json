{"abstract":"In recent years, the task of text-to-SQL translation, which converts natural language questions into executable SQL queries, has gained significant attention for its potential to democratize data access. Despite its promise, challenges such as adapting to unseen databases and aligning natural language with SQL syntax have hindered widespread adoption. To overcome these issues, we introduce SQLformer, a novel Transformer architecture specifically crafted to perform text-to-SQL translation tasks. Our model predicts SQL queries as abstract syntax trees (ASTs) in an autoregressive way, incorporating structural inductive bias in the encoder and decoder layers. This bias, guided by database table and column selection, aids the decoder in generating SQL query ASTs represented as graphs in a Breadth-First Search canonical order. Our experiments demonstrate that SQLformer achieves state-of-the-art performance across six prominent text-to-SQL benchmarks."}
