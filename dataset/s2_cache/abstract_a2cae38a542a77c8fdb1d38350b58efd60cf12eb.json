{"abstract":"In the era of sustainable smart agriculture, a massive amount of agricultural news text is being posted on the Internet, in which massive agricultural knowledge has been accumulated. In this context, it is urgent to explore effective text classification techniques for users to access the required agricultural knowledge with high efficiency. Mainstream deep learning approaches employing fine-tuning strategies on pre-trained language models (PLMs), have demonstrated remarkable performance gains over the past few years. Nonetheless, these methods still face many drawbacks that are complex to solve, including: 1. Limited agricultural training data due to the expensive-cost and labour-intensive annotation; 2. Poor domain transferability, especially of cross-linguistic ability; 3. Complex and expensive large models deployment.Inspired by the extraordinary success brought by the recent ChatGPT (e.g. GPT-3.5, GPT-4), in this work, we systematically investigate and explore the capability and utilization of ChatGPT applying to the agricultural informatization field. ....(shown in article).... Code has been released on Github https://github.com/albert-jin/agricultural_textual_classification_ChatGPT."}
