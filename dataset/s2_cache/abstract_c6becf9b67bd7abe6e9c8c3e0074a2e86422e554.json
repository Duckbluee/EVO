{"abstract":"Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) based on convolutional operations have been developed recently to extract high-level representations from graph data. They have shown advantages in many critical applications, such as recommendation system, natural language processing, and prediction of chemical reactivity. The problem for the GCN is that its target applications generally pose stringent constraints on latency and energy efficiency. Several studies have demonstrated that field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based GCNs accelerators, which balance high performance and low power consumption, can continue to achieve orders-of-magnitude improvements in the inference of GCNs models. However, there still are many challenges in customizing FPGA-based accelerators for GCNs. It is necessary to sort out the current solutions to these challenges for further research. For this purpose, we first summarize the four challenges in FPGA-based GCNs accelerators. Then we introduce the process of the typical GNN algorithm and several examples of representative GCNs. Next, we review the FPGA-based GCNs accelerators in recent years and introduce their design details according to different challenges. Moreover, we compare the key metrics of these accelerators, including resource utilization, performance, and power consumption. Finally, we anticipate the future challenges and directions for FPGA-based GCNs accelerators: algorithm and hardware co-design, efficient task scheduling, higher generality, and faster development."}
