{"abstract":"Multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) is an array signal that represents brain neural networks and can be applied to characterize information propagation patterns for different emotional states. To reveal these inherent spatial graph features and increase the stability of emotion recognition, we propose an effective emotion recognition model that performs multicategory emotion recognition with multiple emotion-related spatial network topology patterns (MESNPs) by learning discriminative graph topologies in EEG brain networks. To evaluate the performance of our proposed MESNP model, we conducted single-subject and multisubject four-class classification experiments on two public datasets, MAHNOB-HCI and DEAP. Compared with existing feature extraction methods, the MESNP model significantly enhances the multiclass emotional classification performance in the single-subject and multisubject conditions. To evaluate the online version of the proposed MESNP model, we designed an online emotion monitoring system. We recruited 14 participants to conduct the online emotion decoding experiments. The average online experimental accuracy of the 14 participants was 84.56%, indicating that our model can be applied in affective brain–computer interface (aBCI) systems. The offline and online experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MESNP model effectively captures discriminative graph topology patterns and significantly improves emotion classification performance. Moreover, the proposed MESNP model provides a new scheme for extracting features from strongly coupled array signals."}
