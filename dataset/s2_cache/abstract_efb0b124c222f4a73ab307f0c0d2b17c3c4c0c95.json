{"abstract":"Recently, transformer has gradually attracted interest for its excellence in modeling the long-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features in HSI. However, transformer has the problem of the quadratic computational complexity due to the self-attention mechanism, which is heavier than other models and thus has limited adoption in HSI processing. Fortunately, the recently emerging state space model-based Mamba shows great computational efficiency while achieving the modeling power of transformers. Therefore, in this paper, we first proposed spectral-spatial Mamba (SS-Mamba) for HSI classification. Specifically, SS-Mamba mainly includes a spectral-spatial token generation module and several stacked spectral-spatial Mamba blocks. Firstly, the token generation module converts any given HSI cube to spatial and spectral tokens as sequences. And then these tokens are sent to stacked spectral-spatial mamba blocks (SS-MB). Each SS-MB includes two basic mamba blocks and a spectral-spatial feature enhancement module. The spatial and spectral tokens are processed separately by the two basic mamba blocks, correspondingly. Moreover, the feature enhancement module modulates spatial and spectral tokens using HSI sample’s center region information. Therefore, the spectral and spatial tokens cooperate with each other and achieve information fusion within each block. The experimental results conducted on widely used HSI datasets reveal that the proposed SS-Mamba requires less processing time compared with transformer. The Mamba-based method thus opens a new window for HSI classification."}
