{"abstract":"Due to the wide use of highly-valuable and large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs), it becomes crucial to protect the intellectual property of DNNs so that the ownership of disputed or stolen DNNs can be verified. Most existing solutions embed backdoors in DNN model training such that DNN ownership can be verified by triggering distinguishable model behaviors with a set of secret inputs. However, such solutions are vulnerable to model fine-tuning and pruning. They also suffer from fraudulent ownership claim as attackers can discover adversarial samples and use them as secret inputs to trigger distinguishable behaviors from stolen models. To address these problems, we propose a novel DNN watermarking solution, named HufuNet, for protecting the ownership of DNN models. We evaluate HufuNet rigorously on four benchmark datasets with five popular DNN models, including convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN). The experiments demonstrate HufuNet is highly robust against model fine-tuning/pruning, kernels cutoff/supplement, functionality-equivalent attack, and fraudulent ownership claims, thus highly promising to protect large-scale DNN models in the real-world."}
