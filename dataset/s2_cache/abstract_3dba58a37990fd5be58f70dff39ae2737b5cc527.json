{"abstract":"Most classification approaches aim at achieving high prediction accuracy on a given dataset. However, in most practical cases, some action such as mailing an offer or treating a patient is to be taken on the classified objects, and we should model not the class probabilities themselves, but instead, the change in class probabilities caused by the action. The action should then be performed on those objects for which it will be most profitable. This problem is known as uplift modeling, differential response analysis, or true lift modeling, but has received very little attention in machine learning literature. An important modification of the problem involves several possible actions, when for each object, the model must also decide which action should be used in order to maximize profit. In this paper, we present tree-based classifiers designed for uplift modeling in both single and multiple treatment cases. To this end, we design new splitting criteria and pruning methods. The experiments confirm the usefulness of the proposed approaches and show significant improvement over previous uplift modeling techniques."}
