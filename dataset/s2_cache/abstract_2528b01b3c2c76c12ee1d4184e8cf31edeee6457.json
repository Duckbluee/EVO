{"abstract":"Relationship-based access control (ReBAC) provides a flexible approach to specify policies based on relationships between system entities, which makes them a natural fit for many modern information systems, beyond online social networks. In this paper we are concerned with the problem of mining ReBAC policies from lower-level authorization information. Mining ReBAC policies can address transforming access control paradigms to ReBAC, reformulating existing ReBAC policies as more information becomes available, as well as inferring potentially unknown policies. Particularly, we propose a systematic algorithm for mining ReBAC authorization policies, and a first of its kind approach to mine graph transition policies that govern the evolution of ReBAC systems. Experimental evaluation manifests efficiency of the proposed approaches."}
