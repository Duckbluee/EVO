{"abstract":"Medical dialogue systems are promising in assisting in telemedicine to increase access to healthcare services, improve the quality of patient care, and reduce medical costs. To facilitate the research and development of medical dialogue systems, we build a large-scale medical dialogue dataset -- MedDialog -- that contains 1.1 million conversations between patients and doctors and 4 million utterances. To our best knowledge, MedDialog is the largest medical dialogue dataset to date. The dataset is available at https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/Medical-Dialogue-System"}
