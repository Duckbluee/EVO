{"abstract":"Reducing speckle noise is an important task for improving visual and automated assessment of retinal OCT images. Traditional image/signal processing methods only offer moderate speckle reduction; deep learning methods can be more effective but require substantial training data, which may not be readily available. We present a novel self-fusion method that offers effective speckle reduction comparable to deep learning methods, but without any external training data. We present qualitative and quantitative results in a variety of datasets from fovea and optic nerve head regions, with varying SNR values for input images."}
