{"abstract":"The task of the Intent Classification & Slot Filling serves as a key joint task in the voice assistant, which also plays the role of the pre-work in the construction of the medical consultation assistant system. How to distribute a doctor-patient conversation into a formatted electronic medical record to an accurate department (Intent Classification) to extract the key named entities or mentions (Slot Filling) through a specialized domain knowledge recognizer is one of the key steps of the entire system. In real cases, the medical vocabulary and clinical entities in different departments of the hospital often differ to some extent. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive model based on CMed-BERT, RCNN and BiGRU-CRF for a joint task of department identification and slot filling of the specific domain. Experimental results confirmed the competitiveness of our model."}
