{"abstract":"Designing complex 3D scenes has been a tedious, manual process requiring domain expertise. Emerging text-to-3D generative models show great promise for making this task more intuitive, but existing approaches are limited to object-level generation. We introduce locally conditioned diffusion as an approach to compositional scene diffusion, providing control over semantic parts using text prompts and bounding boxes while ensuring seamless transitions between these parts. We demonstrate a score distillation sampling-based text-to-3D synthesis pipeline that enables compositional 3D scene generation at a higher fidelity than relevant baselines."}
