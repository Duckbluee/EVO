{"abstract":"Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) aims to identify the snippets involving anomalous events in long untrimmed videos, with solely text video-level binary labels. A typical paradigm among the existing text WS-VAD methods is to employ multiple modalities as inputs, e.g., RGB, optical flow, and audio, as they can provide sufficient discriminative clues that are robust to the diverse, complicated real-world scenes. However, such a pipeline has high reliance on the availability of multiple modalities and is computationally expensive and storage demanding in processing long sequences, which limits its use in some applications. To address this dilemma, we propose a privileged knowledge distillation (KD) framework dedicated to the WS-VAD task, which can maintain the benefits of exploiting additional modalities, while avoiding the need for using multimodal data in the inference phase. We argue that the performance of the privileged KD framework mainly depends on two factors: 1) the effectiveness of the multimodal teacher network and 2) the completeness of the useful information transfer. To obtain a reliable teacher network, we propose a text cross-modal interactive learning strategy and an anomaly normal discrimination loss, which target learning task-specific cross-modal features and encourage the separability of anomalous and normal representations, respectively. Furthermore, we design both representation- and text logits-level distillation loss functions, which force the unimodal student network to distill abundant privileged knowledge from the text well-trained multimodal teacher network, in a snippet-to-video fashion. Extensive experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed privileged KD framework can train a lightweight yet effective detector, for localizing anomaly events under the supervision of video-level annotations."}
