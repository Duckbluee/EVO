{"abstract":"We argue that a perfect storm of five conditions heightens the risk of harm to society from artificial intelligence: (1) the powerful, invisible nature of AI, (2) low public awareness and AI literacy, (3) rapid scaled deployment of AI, (4) insufficient regulation, and (5) the gap between trustworthy AI principles and practices. To prevent harm, fit-for-purpose regulation and public AI literacy programs have been recommended, but education and government regulation will not be sufficient: AI-deploying organizations need to play a central role in creating and deploying trustworthy AI in line with the principles of trustworthy AI, and taking accountability to mitigate the risks."}
