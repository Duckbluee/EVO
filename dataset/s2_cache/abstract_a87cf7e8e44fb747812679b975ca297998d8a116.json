{"abstract":"In this paper, we describe the state of our work on the possible derivation of ontological structures from textual analysis. We propose an approach to semi-automatic generation of domain ontologies from scratch, on the basis of heuristic rules applied to the result of a multi-layered processing of textual documents."}
