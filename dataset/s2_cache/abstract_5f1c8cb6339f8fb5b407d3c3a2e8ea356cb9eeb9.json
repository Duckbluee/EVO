{"abstract":"Learning with feature evolution studies the scenario where the features of the data streams can evolve, i.e., old features vanish and new features emerge. Its goal is to keep the model always performing well even when the features happen to evolve. To tackle this problem, canonical methods assume that the old features will vanish simultaneously and the new features themselves will emerge simultaneously as well. They also assume that there is an overlapping period where old and new features both exist when the feature space starts to change. However, in reality, the feature evolution could be unpredictable, which means that the features can vanish or emerge arbitrarily, causing the overlapping period incomplete. In this article, we propose a novel paradigm: prediction with unpredictable feature evolution (PUFE) where the feature evolution is unpredictable. To address this problem, we fill the incomplete overlapping period and formulate it as a new matrix completion problem. We give a theoretical bound on the least number of observed entries to make the overlapping period intact. With this intact overlapping period, we leverage an ensemble method to take the advantage of both the old and new feature spaces without manually deciding which base models should be incorporated. Theoretical and experimental results validate that our method can always follow the best base models and, thus, realize the goal of learning with feature evolution."}
