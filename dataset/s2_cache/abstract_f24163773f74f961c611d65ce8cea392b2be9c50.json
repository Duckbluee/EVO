{"abstract":"We present a comprehensive analysis of deep learning approaches for Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series imputation, examining how the interplay between architectural and framework design decisions gives rise to higher-level properties of a given deep imputer model and distinct biases towards complex data characteristics. Our investigation reveals the varying capabilities of deep imputers in capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies within EHRs, and that the effectiveness of the model depends on how its combined biases align with the characteristics of the medical time series. Our experimental evaluation challenges common assumptions about model complexity, demonstrating that larger models do not necessarily improve performance. Rather, carefully designed architectures can better capture the complex patterns inherent in clinical data. The study highlights the need for imputation approaches that prioritise clinically meaningful data reconstruction over statistical accuracy. Our experiments further reveal up to 20% in variations of imputation performance based on preprocessing and implementation choices, emphasising the need for standardised benchmarking methodologies. Finally, we identify critical gaps between current deep imputation methods and medical requirements, highlighting the importance of integrating clinical insights to achieve more reliable imputation approaches for healthcare applications."}
