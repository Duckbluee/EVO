{"abstract":"Analytical reasoning is an essential and chal- 001 lenging task that requires a system to analyze 002 a scenario involving a set of particular circum- 003 stances and perform reasoning over it to make 004 conclusions. However, current neural models 005 with implicit reasoning ability struggle to solve 006 this task. In this paper, we study the challenge 007 of analytical reasoning of text and collect a new 008 dataset consisting of questions from the Law 009 School Admission Test from 1991 to 2016. We 010 analyze what knowledge understanding and rea- 011 soning abilities are required to do well on this 012 task, and present an approach dubbed ARM. 013 It extracts knowledge such as participants and 014 facts from the context. Such knowledge are 015 applied to an inference engine to deduce legit- 016 imate solutions for drawing conclusions. In 017 our experiments, we find that ubiquitous pre- 018 trained models struggle to deal with this task as 019 their performance is close to random guess. Re- 020 sults show that ARM outperforms pre-trained 021 models significantly. Moreover, we demon- 022 strate that ARM has better explicit interpretable 023 reasoning ability. 1 024"}
