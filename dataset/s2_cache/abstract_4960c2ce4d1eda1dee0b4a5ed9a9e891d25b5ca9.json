{"abstract":"The translation of natural language questions to SQL queries has attracted growing attention, in particular in connection with transformers and similar language models. A large number of techniques are geared towards the English language; in this work, we thus investigated translation to SQL when input questions are given in the Portuguese language. To do so, we properly adapted state-of-the-art tools and resources. We changed the RAT-SQL+GAP system by relying on a multilingual BART model (we report tests with other language models), and we produced a translated version of the Spider dataset. Our experiments expose interesting phenomena that arise when non-English languages are targeted; in particular, it is better to train with original and translated training datasets together, even if a single target language is desired. This multilingual BART model fine-tuned with a double-size training dataset (English and Portuguese) achieved 83% of the baseline, making inferences for the Portuguese test dataset. This investigation can help other researchers to produce results in Machine Learning in a language different from English. Our multilingual ready version of RAT-SQL+GAP and the data are available, open-sourced as mRAT-SQL+GAP at: https://github.com/C4AI/gap-text2sql"}
