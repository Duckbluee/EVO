{"abstract":"This first chapter (out of ten dedicated to each of the ten public action resources) deals with the resource Force. It specifies, inter alia, new forms of this resource (nudging, cybercrime), describes penal regulations of the use of Force, and clarifies the relation between Force and Property. As in the following nine chapters, the examples provided are structured around the mobilization and availability of the resource, the mobilization of the resource by stage (program formulation and implementation), and the exchange of the resource Force for other resources (e.g. Law, Money and Information). Again, as in the other nine chapters, these sections are subdivided into paragraphs dedicated to the three actor groups (political-administrative actors, target groups and beneficiaries). The examples presented are drawn from penal law prosecutions (especially ‘legitimate defence’) and infrastructure policies."}
