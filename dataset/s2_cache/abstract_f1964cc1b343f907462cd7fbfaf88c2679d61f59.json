{"abstract":"We consider the problem of representation learning for graph data. Given images are special cases of graphs with nodes lie on 2D lattices, graph embedding tasks have a natural correspondence with image pixel-wise prediction tasks such as segmentation. While encoder-decoder architectures like U-Nets have been successfully applied to image pixel-wise prediction tasks, similar methods are lacking for graph data. This is because pooling and up-sampling operations are not natural on graph data. To address these challenges, we propose novel graph pooling and unpooling operations. The gPool layer adaptively selects some nodes to form a smaller graph based on their scalar projection values. We further propose the gUnpool layer as the inverse operation of the gPool layer. Based on our proposed methods, we develop an encoder-decoder model, known as the graph U-Nets. Experimental results on node classification and graph classification tasks demonstrate that our methods achieve consistently better performance than previous models. Along this direction, we extend our methods by integrating attention mechanisms. Based on attention operators, we proposed attention-based pooling and unpooling layers, which can better capture graph topology information. The empirical results on graph classification tasks demonstrate the promising capability of our methods."}
