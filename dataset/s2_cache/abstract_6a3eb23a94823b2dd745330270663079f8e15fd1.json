{"abstract":"Many ontologies, in particular in the biomedical domain, are based on the Description Logic EL++. Several efforts have been made to interpret and exploit EL++ ontologies by distributed representation learning. Specifically, concepts within EL++ theories have been represented as n-balls within an n-dimensional embedding space. However, the intersectional closure is not satisfied when using n-balls to represent concepts because the intersection of two n-balls is not an n-ball. This leads to challenges when measuring the distance between concepts and inferring equivalence between concepts. To this end, we developed EL Box Embedding (ELBE) to learn Description Logic EL++ embeddings using axis-parallel boxes. We generate specially designed box-based geometric constraints from EL++ axioms for model training. Since the intersection of boxes remains as a box, the intersectional closure is satisfied. We report extensive experimental results on three datasets and present a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}
