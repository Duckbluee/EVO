{"abstract":"In this paper we present a novel robot navigation approach based on the so-called Social Force Model (SFM). First, we construct a graph map with a set of destinations that completely describe the navigation environment. Second, we propose a robot navigation algorithm, called social-aware navigation, which is mainly driven by the social-forces centered at the robot. Third, we use a MCMC Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in order to learn the parameters values of the method. Finally, the validation of the model is accomplished throughout an extensive set of simulations and real-life experiments."}
