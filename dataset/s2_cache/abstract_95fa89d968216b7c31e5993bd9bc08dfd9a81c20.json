{"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce Matten, a cutting-edge latent diffusion model with Mamba-Attention architecture for video generation. With minimal computational cost, Matten employs spatial-temporal attention for local video content modeling and bidirectional Mamba for global video content modeling. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that Matten has competitive performance with the current Transformer-based and GAN-based models in benchmark performance, achieving superior FVD scores and efficiency. Additionally, we observe a direct positive correlation between the complexity of our designed model and the improvement in video quality, indicating the excellent scalability of Matten."}
