{"abstract":"The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has recently gained popularity in the field of image segmentation due to its impressive capabilities in various segmentation tasks and its prompt-based interface. However, recent studies and individual experiments have shown that SAM underperforms in medical image segmentation due to the lack of medical-specific knowledge. This raises the question of how to enhance SAM's segmentation capability for medical images. We propose the Medical SAM Adapter (Med-SA), which is one of the first methods to integrate SAM into medical image segmentation. Med-SA uses a light yet effective adaptation technique instead of fine-tuning the SAM model, incorporating domain-specific medical knowledge into the segmentation model. We also propose Space-Depth Transpose (SD-Trans) to adapt 2D SAM to 3D medical images and Hyper-Prompting Adapter (HyP-Adpt) to achieve prompt-conditioned adaptation. Comprehensive evaluation experiments on 17 medical image segmentation tasks across various modalities demonstrate the superior performance of Med-SA while updating only 2% of the SAM parameters (13M). Our code is released at https://github.com/KidsWithTokens/Medical-SAM-Adapter."}
