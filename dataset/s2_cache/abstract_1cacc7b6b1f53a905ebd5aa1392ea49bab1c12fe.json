{"abstract":"Answer selection, ranking high-quality answers first, is a significant problem for the community question answering sites. Existing approaches usually consider it as a text matching task, and then calculate the quality of answers via their semantic relevance to the given question. However, they thoroughly ignore the influence of other multiple factors in the community, such as the user expertise. In this paper, we propose an answer selection model based on the user expertise modeling, which simultaneously considers the social influence and the personal interest that affect the user expertise from different views. Specifically, we propose an inductive strategy to aggregate the social influence of neighbors. Besides, we introduce the explicit topic interest of users and capture the context-based personal interest by weighing the activation of each topic. Moreover, we construct two real-world datasets containing rich user information. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art models."}
