{"abstract":"Consensus clustering provides an elegant framework to aggregate multiple weak clustering results to learn a consensus one that is more robust and stable than a single result. However, most of the existing methods usually use all data for consensus learning, whereas ignoring the side effects caused by some unreliable or difficult data. To address this issue, in this article, we propose a novel self-paced consensus clustering method with adaptive bipartite graph learning to gradually involve data from more reliable to less reliable ones in consensus learning. At first, we construct an initial bipartite graph from the base results, where the nodes represent the clusters and instances, and the edges indicate that an instance belongs to a cluster. Then, we adaptively learn a structured bipartite graph from this initial one by self-paced learning, i.e., we automatically determine the reliability of each edge with adaptive cluster similarity measuring and involve the edges in bipartite graph learning in order of their reliability. At last, we obtain the final consensus result from the learned structured bipartite graph. We conduct extensive experiments on both toy and benchmark datasets, and the results show the effectiveness and superiority of our method.
