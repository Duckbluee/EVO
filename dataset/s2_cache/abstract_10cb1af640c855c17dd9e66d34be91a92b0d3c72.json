{"abstract":"With the increment of data sets and models sizes, distributed deep learning has been proposed to accelerate training and improve the accuracy of DNN models. The parameter server framework is a popular collaborative architecture for data-parallel training, which works well for homogeneous environments by properly aggregating the computation/communication capabilities of different workers. However, in heterogeneous environments, the resources of different workers vary a lot. Some stragglers may seriously limit the whole speed, which impacts the overall training process. In this paper, we propose an adaptive multi-stage distributed deep learning training framework, named ASHL, for heterogeneous environments. First, a profiling scheme is proposed to capture the capabilities of each worker to reasonably plan the training and communication tasks on each worker, and lay the foundation for the formal training. Second, a hybrid-mode training scheme (i.e., coarse-grained and fined-grained training) is proposed to balance the model accuracy and training speed. The coarse-grained training scheme (named AHL) adopts an asynchronous communication strategy, which involves less frequent communications. Its main goal is to make the model quickly converge to a certain level. The fine-grained training stage (named SHL) uses a semi-asynchronous communication strategy and adopts a high communication frequency. Its main goal is to improve the model convergence effect. Finally, a compression-based communication scheme is proposed to further increase the communication efficiency of the training process. Our experimental results show that ASHL reduces the overall training time by more than 35% to converge to the same degree and has better generalization ability compared with state-of-the-art schemes like ADSP."}
