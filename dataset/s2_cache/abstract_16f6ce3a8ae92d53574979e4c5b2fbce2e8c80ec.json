{"abstract":"It has been suggested that autonomous vehicles can improve efficiency and safety of the transportation systems. While research in this area often focuses on autonomous vehicles which operate on roads, the deployment of low-speed, autonomous vehicles in unstructured, crowded environments has been studied less well and requires specific considerations regarding their interaction with pedestrians. For making the operation of these vehicles acceptable, their behaviour needs to be perceived as safe by both pedestrians and the passengers riding the vehicle. In this paper we conducted an online survey with 116 participants, to understand people’s preferences with respect to an autonomous golf cart’s behaviour in different interaction scenarios. We measured people’s self-reported perceived safety towards different behaviour of the cart in a variety of scenarios. Results suggested that despite the unstructured nature of the environment, the cart was expected to follow common traffic rules when interacting with a group of pedestrians."}
