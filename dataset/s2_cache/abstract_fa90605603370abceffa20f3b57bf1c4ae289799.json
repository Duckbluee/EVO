{"abstract":"With the rapid evolution of AI Generated Content (AIGC), forged images produced through this technology are inherently more deceptive and require less human intervention compared to traditional Computer-generated Graphics (CG). However, owing to the disparities between CG and AIGC, conventional CG detection methods tend to be inadequate in identifying AIGC-produced images. To address this issue, our research concentrates on the text-to-image generation process in AIGC. Initially, we first assemble two text-to-image databases utilizing two distinct AI systems, DALL•E2 and DreamStudio. Aiming to holistically capture the inherent anomalies produced by AIGC, we develope a robust dual-stream network comprised of a residual stream and a content stream. The former employs the Spatial Rich Model (SRM) to meticulously extract various texture information from images, while the latter seeks to capture additional forged traces in low frequency, thereby extracting complementary information that the residual stream may overlook. To enhance the information exchange between these two streams, we incorporate a cross multi-head attention mechanism. Numerous comparative experiments are performed on both databases, and the results show that our detection method consistently outperforms traditional CG detection techniques across a range of image resolutions. Moreover, our method exhibits superior performance through a series of robustness tests and cross-database experiments. When applied to widely recognized traditional CG benchmarks such as SPL2018 and DsTok, our approach significantly exceeds the capabilities of other existing methods in the field of CG detection."}
