{"abstract":"Temporal volume images with 3D+t (4D) information are often used in medical imaging to statistically analyze temporal dynamics or capture disease progression. Although deep-learning-based generative models for natural images have been extensively studied, approaches for temporal medical image generation such as 4D cardiac volume data are limited. In this work, we present a novel deep learning model that generates intermediate temporal volumes between source and target volumes. Specifically, we propose a diffusion deformable model (DDM) by adapting the denoising diffusion probabilistic model that has recently been widely investigated for realistic image generation. Our proposed DDM is composed of the diffusion and the deformation modules so that DDM can learn spatial deformation information between the source and target volumes and provide a latent code for generating intermediate frames along a geodesic path. Once our model is trained, the latent code estimated from the diffusion module is simply interpolated and fed into the deformation module, which enables DDM to generate temporal frames along the continuous trajectory while preserving the topology of the source image. We demonstrate the proposed method with the 4D cardiac MR image generation between the diastolic and systolic phases for each subject. Compared to the existing deformation methods, our DDM achieves high performance on temporal volume generation."}
