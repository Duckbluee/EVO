{"abstract":": Because of the importance of the web in our daily lives, phishing attacks have been causing a signiﬁcant damage to both individuals and organizations. Indeed, phishing attacks are today among the most widespread and serious threats to the web and its users. Currently, the main approaches deployed against such attacks are blacklists. However, the latter represent numerous drawbacks. In this paper, we introduce PhishGNN, a Deep Learning framework based on Graph Neural Networks, which leverages and uses the hyperlink graph structure of websites along with different other hand-designed features. The performance results obtained, demonstrate that PhishGNN outperforms state of the art results with a 99.7% prediction accuracy."}
