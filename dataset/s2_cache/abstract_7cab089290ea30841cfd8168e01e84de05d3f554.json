{"abstract":"In this study, a new algorithm that can be used for copyright protection is proposed for the embedding and detection of a watermark in the domain of discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The elements of the logo watermark are embedded directly to the three-level DWT decomposed subbands. In addition to that, the scheme is considered as a completely blind scheme for both host image and watermark. Two kinds of security attacks have also been considered which confirms the security of the scheme. The experimental results and computer simulation of the proposed scheme have shown that the proposed approach has the desired properties such as invisibility, blind detection, and robustness against various geometrical and non-geometrical attacks."}
