{"abstract":"Abstract The huge amount of research papers on the web makes finding a relevant manuscript a difficult task. In recent years many models were introduced to support researchers by providing personalized citation recommendations. Moreover, deep learning methods have been employed in this domain to improve the quality of the final recommendations. However, a thorough study that classifies citation recommendation models and examines their (a) strengths and weaknesses, (b) evaluation metrics used, (c) popular datasets, and challenges faced is missing. Therefore, with this survey, we present a new classification approach for deep learning models that provide citation recommendation. Our approach uses the following six criteria: data factors, data representation methods, methodologies, types of recommendations used, problems addressed, and personalization. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis of those models that use the same set of evaluation metrics and datasets. Moreover, we examine hot upcoming issues and solutions in light of explored literature. Also, the survey discusses and analyzes the evaluation metrics and datasets adopted by the explored models. Finally, we conclude our survey with trends and future directions to further assist research on that domain."}
