{"abstract":"Cloud technology has brought great convenience to enterprises as well as customers. System logs record notable events and are becoming valuable resources to track and investigate system status. Detecting anomaly from logs as fast as possible can improve the quality of service significantly. Although many machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression) have high detection accuracy, we find that they assume data are clean and might have high training time. Facing these challenges, in this paper, we propose Robust Online Evolving Anomaly Detection (ROEAD) framework which adopts Robust Feature Extractor (RFE) to remove the effects of noise and Online Evolving Anomaly Detection (OEAD) to dynamic update parameters. We propose Online Evolving SVM (OES) algorithm as the example of online anomaly detection methods. We analyze the performance of OES in theory and prove the performance difference between OES and the best hypothesis tends to zero as time goes infinity. We compare the performance of ROEAD against state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms using public log datasets. The results demonstrate that ROEAD is able to remove the effects of noise and OES can improve the detection accuracy by more than 40%."}
