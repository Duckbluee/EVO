{"abstract":"Research on trafﬁc forecasting in transportation has received worldwide concern over the past three decades. While there are comprehensive review studies on trafﬁc forecasting, few of them explore the research advancement in this ﬁeld from a visual perspective. With the help of CiteSpace and VOSviewer, this study uses scientometric review to identify the evolution and emerging trends of the research in the ﬁeld. Totally, 1536 bibliographic records with references are extracted from Web of Science and used as the datasets to form the author network, institutional network, keyword network, and co-citation network. The visualization of the results characterizes the research progress in the ﬁeld. It can be found that Eleni I. Vlahogianni receives the highest citation frequency, China and the United States contribute most of the journal articles. Some inﬂuential institutions and articles are also identiﬁed. With the author keyword network, the words “recurrent neural network”, “convolutional neural network”, “spatio-temporal correlation”, “trafﬁc pattern”, and “feature selection” are identiﬁed as the emerging trends. Also, the document citation bursts reveal that the applications of combined models and the study of trafﬁc ﬂow forecasting in atypical situations are becoming the emerging trends. This study provides a valuable reference for the research community in this ﬁeld."}
