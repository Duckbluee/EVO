{"abstract":"Reinforcement occurs when a consequence to a behavior makes it more likely that behavior will happen again. • Simple example: Making eye contact when someone is talking to you. Saying “Good” when a child starts to tie her shoe. • Reinforcers may be tangible (e.g. stickers, food, games, money, access to friends, privileges) or intangible (praise, attention, showing interest, encouragement)  Social reinforcers usually work best!"}
