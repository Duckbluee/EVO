{"abstract":"Online parameter control has proved to offer significant performance boost in metaheuristics. Common parameterization methods (tuners) typically involve their own parameters that affect their dynamics. Although the potential of completely removing the user out of the tuning cycle is questionable, taking more informative autonomous decisions is highly desirable as part of the general pursuit of artificial intelligence. Towards this goal, we propose an enhanced version of a recently proposed gradient-based parameter adaptation method that can be used by any population-based metaheuristic. The enhancement lies in the use of reinforcement learning to adapt the tuner’s parameters, offering overall performance gains. The REINFORCE family of algorithms is considered in the present paper as the proof-of-concept approach. The proposed method is demonstrated on the differential evolution algorithm, which stands among the most popular metaheuristics. Experimental assessment on an established test suite offers promising results, also verifying previous evidence regarding the tuner’s robustness and simplicity."}
