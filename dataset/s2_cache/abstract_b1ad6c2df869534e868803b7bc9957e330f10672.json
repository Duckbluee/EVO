{"abstract":"We describe a publicly available dataset of annotated Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) studies. 1014 whole body Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT datasets (501 studies of patients with malignant lymphoma, melanoma and non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 513 studies without PET-positive malignant lesions (negative controls)) acquired between 2014 and 2018 were included. All examinations were acquired on a single, state-of-the-art PET/CT scanner. The imaging protocol consisted of a whole-body FDG-PET acquisition and a corresponding diagnostic CT scan. All FDG-avid lesions identified as malignant based on the clinical PET/CT report were manually segmented on PET images in a slice-per-slice (3D) manner. We provide the anonymized original DICOM files of all studies as well as the corresponding DICOM segmentation masks. In addition, we provide scripts for image processing and conversion to different file formats (NIfTI, mha, hdf5). Primary diagnosis, age and sex are provided as non-imaging information. We demonstrate how this dataset can be used for deep learning-based automated analysis of PET/CT data and provide the trained deep learning model.
