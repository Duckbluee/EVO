{"abstract":"Quantitative assessment of the abdominal region from CT scans requires the accurate delineation of abdominal organs. Therefore, automatic abdominal image segmentation has been the subject of intensive research for the past two decades. Recently, deep learning-based methods have resulted in state-of-the-art performance for the 3D abdominal CT segmentation. However, the complex characterization of abdominal organs with weak boundaries prevents the deep learning methods from accurate segmentation. Specifically, the voxels on the boundary of organs are more vulnerable to misprediction due to the highly-varying intensities. This paper proposes a method for improved abdominal image segmentation by leveraging organ-boundary prediction as a complementary task. We train 3D encoder-decoder networks to simultaneously segment the abdominal organs and their boundaries via multi-task learning. We explore two network topologies based on the extent of weights shared between the two tasks within a unified multi-task framework. In the first topology, the whole-organ prediction task and the boundary detection task share all the layers in the network except for the last task-specific layers. The second topology employs a single shared encoder but two separate task-specific decoders. The effectiveness of utilizing the organs’ boundary information for abdominal multi-organ segmentation is evaluated on two publically available abdominal CT datasets: Pancreas-CT and the BTCV dataset. The improvements shown in segmentation results reveal the advantage of the multi-task training that forces the network to pay attention to ambiguous boundaries of organs. A maximum relative improvement of 3.5% and 3.6% is observed in Mean Dice Score for Pancreas-CT and BTCV datasets, respectively."}
