{"abstract":"Keyphrase extraction is a textual information processing task concerned with the automatic extraction of representative and characteristic phrases from a document that express all the key aspects of its content. Keyphrases constitute a succinct conceptual summary of a document, which is very useful in digital information management systems for semantic indexing, faceted search, document clustering and classification. This article introduces keyphrase extraction, provides a well‐structured review of the existing work, offers interesting insights on the different evaluation approaches, highlights open issues and presents a comparative experimental study of popular unsupervised techniques on five datasets."}
