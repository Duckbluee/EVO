{"abstract":"Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are capable of capturing high-definition images from onboard sensors, which can be used to facilitate the detection of objects in the vicinity. Such images may, however, contain sensitive information (e.g., human faces and license plates) as well as the indirect location of CAVs. To protect the object privacy of images shared by CAVs, this article proposes a privacy-preserving object detection (P2OD) framework. Specifically, we propose multiple secure computing protocols designed to construct a privacy-preserving Faster $R$ -convolutional neural network (CNN) model to securely extract features and bounding-boxes of objects in an image. By leveraging edge computing (with higher performance computation and lower latency, in comparison to cloud-based solutions), CAVs randomly split the captured images and upload them to two noncollusive edge servers. Both servers will then perform the P2OD framework cooperatively to directly detect objects over random image shares without exposing sensitive information. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the security, correctness, and efficiency of the P2OD framework, and the experimental findings show that the P2OD framework can effectively protect the classification and location privacy of image objects for CAVs. Compared with the original Faster R-CNN model, the classification and regression errors of the P2OD framework can be controlled within 10−12 and 10−14, respectively."}
