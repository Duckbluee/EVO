{"abstract":"Research Collaborators for structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (RCBS PDB) began in 1970’s by group of the young crystallographers, including Edgar Meyer, Gerson Coheon and Helen M Berman.[1] The project was initiated in 1971 to list the structures of all the amino acids using neutron diffraction and has grown as a major international resource for structural biology containing more than 80,000 entries including proteins: 77,529; nucleic acids: 2420; proteins/ DNA complexes: 3795 and other: 24 (totally 83,768 entries) as of Tuesday Aug 14, 2012 at 5 PM DST. The website also proclaims that there have been 62987 structure hits and 11915 ligand hits on this date and that the PDB has 24583 citations."}
