{"abstract":"Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is a task that requires machine to understand natural language and answer questions by reading a document. It is the core of automatic response technology such as chatbots and automatized customer supporting systems. We present Korean Question Answering Dataset(KorQuAD), a large-scale Korean dataset for extractive machine reading comprehension task. It consists of 70,000+ human generated question-answer pairs on Korean Wikipedia articles. We release KorQuAD1.0 and launch a challenge at this https URL to encourage the development of multilingual natural language processing research."}
