{"abstract":"Image caption technology is a new task in the field of computer vision after relay image recognition, image segmentation and object detection. This technology can input the image of the computer, through the mathematical model and the powerful calculation of the computer, and finally output the descriptive text that is highly related to the content of the image. In order to have a clear understanding of the current research status of image caption tasks and look forward to the future, this paper reviews the research progress of image caption tasks. In order to have a clear understanding of the current research status of image caption tasks and look forward to the future, this paper reviews the research progress of image caption tasks. This paper summarizes related methods, applicable datasets, and evaluation metrics for image caption tasks."}
