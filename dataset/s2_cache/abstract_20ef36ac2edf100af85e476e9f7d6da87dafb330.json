{"abstract":"Brain decoding is a field of computational neuroscience that uses measurable brain activity to infer mental states or internal representations of perceptual inputs. Therefore, we propose a novel approach to brain decoding that also relies on semantic and contextual similarity. We employ an fMRI dataset of natural image vision and create a deep learning decoding pipeline inspired by the existence of both bottom-up and top-down processes in human vision. We train a linear brain-to-feature model to map fMRI activity features to visual stimuli features, assuming that the brain projects visual information onto a space that is homeomorphic to the latent space represented by the last convolutional layer of a pretrained convolutional neural network, which typically collects a variety of semantic features that summarize and highlight similarities and differences between concepts. These features are then categorized in the latent space using a nearest-neighbor strategy, and the results are used to condition a generative latent diffusion model to create novel images. From fMRI data only, we produce reconstructions of visual stimuli that match the original content very well on a semantic level, surpassing the state of the art in previous literature. We evaluate our work and obtain good results using a quantitative semantic metric (the Wu-Palmer similarity metric over the WordNet lexicon, which had an average value of 0.57) and perform a human evaluation experiment that resulted in correct evaluation, according to the multiplicity of human criteria in evaluating image similarity, in over 80% of the test set."}
