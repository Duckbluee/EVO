{"abstract":"Recent studies reveal that even highly biased dense networks can contain an invariant substructure with superior out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. While existing works commonly seek these substructures using global sparsity constraints, the uniform imposition of sparse penalties across samples with diverse levels of spurious contents renders such methods suboptimal. The precise adaptation of model sparsity, specifically tailored for spurious features, remains a significant challenge. Motivated by the insight that in-distribution (ID) data containing spurious features may exhibit lower experiential risk, we propose a novel Spurious Feature-targeted Pruning framework, dubbed SFP, to induce the authentic invariant substructures without referring to the above concerns. Specifically, SFP distinguishes spurious features within ID instances during training by a theoretically validated threshold. It then penalizes the corresponding feature projections onto the model space, steering the optimization towards subspaces spanned by those invariant factors. Moreover, we also conduct detailed theoretical analysis to provide a rationality guarantee and a proof framework for OOD structures based on model sparsity. Experiments on various OOD datasets show that SFP can significantly outperform both structure-based and non-structure-based OOD generalization state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by large margins."}
