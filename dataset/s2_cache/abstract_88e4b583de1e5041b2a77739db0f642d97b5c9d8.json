{"abstract":"Natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) aims to parse a natural language with a given database into a SQL query, which widely appears in practical Internet applications. Jointly encode database schema and question utterance is a difficult but important task in NL2SQL. One solution is to treat the input as a heterogeneous graph. However, it failed to learn good word representation in question utterance. Learning better word representation is important for constructing a well-designed NL2SQL system. To solve the challenging task, we present a Relation aware Semi-autogressive Semantic Parsing (\\MODN) ~framework, which is more adaptable for NL2SQL. It first learns relation embedding over the schema entities and question words with predefined schema relations with ELECTRA and relation aware transformer layer as backbone. Then we decode the query SQL with a semi-autoregressive parser and predefined SQL syntax. From empirical results and case study, our model shows its effectiveness in learning better word representation in NL2SQL."}
