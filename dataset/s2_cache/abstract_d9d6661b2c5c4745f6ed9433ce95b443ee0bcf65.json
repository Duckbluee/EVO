{"abstract":"Trajectory clustering has played an essential role in trajectory mining tasks. It serves in a wide range of real-life applications, including transportation, location-based services, behavioral study, and so on. To support trajectory clustering analytics, a plethora of trajectory clustering methods have been proposed, which mainly extend traditional clustering algorithms by using spatio-temporal characteristics of trajectories. However, existing traditional trajectory clustering approaches based on raw trajectory representation highly rely on hand-craft similarity metrics, and can not capture hidden spatial dependencies in trajectory data, which is inefficient and inflexible for clustering analysis. To this end, we propose an end-to-end deep trajectory clustering framework via self-training, termed as E2DTC, inspired by the data-driven capabilities of deep neural networks. E2DTC does not require any additional manual feature extraction operations, and can be easily adapted for trajectory clustering analytics on any trajectory dataset. Extensive experimental evaluations on three real-life datasets show that our framework E2DTC achieves superior accuracy and efficiency, compared with classical clustering methods (i.e., K-Medoids) and state-of-the-art neural-network based approaches (i.e., t2vec)."}
