{"abstract":"With the advent of Web 2.0, there exist many online platforms that result in massive textual-data production. With ever-increasing textual data at hand, it is of immense importance to extract information nuggets from this data. One approach towards effective harnessing of this unstructured textual data could be its transformation into structured text. Hence, this study aims to present an overview of approaches that can be applied to extract key insights from textual data in a structured way. For this, Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction are being majorly addressed in this review study. The former deals with identification of named entities, and the latter deals with problem of extracting relation between set of entities. This study covers early approaches as well as the developments made up till now using machine learning models. Survey findings conclude that deep-learning-based hybrid and joint models are currently governing the state-of-the-art. It is also observed that annotated benchmark datasets for various textual-data generators such as Twitter and other social forums are not available. This scarcity of dataset has resulted into relatively less progress in these domains. Additionally, the majority of the state-of-the-art techniques are offline and computationally expensive. Last, with increasing focus on deep-learning frameworks, there is need to understand and explain the under-going processes in deep architectures."}
