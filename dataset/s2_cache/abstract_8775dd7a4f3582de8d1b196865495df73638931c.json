{"abstract":"Colonoscopy is a procedure to detect colorectal polyps which are the primary cause for developing colorectal cancer. However, polyp segmentation is a challenging task due to the diverse shape, size, color, and texture of polyps, shuttle difference between polyp and its background, as well as low contrast of the colonoscopic images. To address these challenges, we propose a feature enhancement network for accurate polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images. Specifically, the proposed network enhances the semantic information using the novel Semantic Feature Enhance Module (SFEM). Furthermore, instead of directly adding encoder features to the respective decoder layer, we introduce an Adaptive Global Context Module (AGCM), which focuses only on the encoder’s significant and hard fine-grained features. The integration of these two modules improves the quality of features layer by layer, which in turn enhances the final feature representation. The proposed approach is evaluated on five colonoscopy datasets and demonstrates superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art models."}
