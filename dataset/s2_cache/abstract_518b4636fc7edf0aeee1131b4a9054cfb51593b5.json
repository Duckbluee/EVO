{"abstract":"Omnidirectional image (ODI) data is captured with a 360x180 field-of-view, which is much wider than the pinhole cameras and contains richer spatial information than the conventional planar images. Accordingly, omnidirectional vision has attracted booming attention due to its more advantageous performance in numerous applications, such as autonomous driving and virtual reality. In recent years, the availability of customer-level 360 cameras has made omnidirectional vision more popular, and the advance of deep learning (DL) has significantly sparked its research and applications. This paper presents a systematic and comprehensive review and analysis of the recent progress in DL methods for omnidirectional vision. Our work covers four main contents: (i) An introduction to the principle of omnidirectional imaging, the convolution methods on the ODI, and datasets to highlight the differences and difficulties compared with the 2D planar image data; (ii) A structural and hierarchical taxonomy of the DL methods for omnidirectional vision; (iii) A summarization of the latest novel learning strategies and applications; (iv) An insightful discussion of the challenges and open problems by highlighting the potential research directions to trigger more research in the community."}
