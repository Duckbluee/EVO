{"abstract":"Although increasing amounts of transaction data make it possible to characterize uncertainties surrounding customer service requests, few methods integrate predictive tools with prescriptive optimization procedures to meet growing demand for small-volume urban transport services. We incorporate temporal and spatial anticipation of service requests into approximate dynamic programming (ADP) procedures to yield dynamic routing policies for the single-vehicle routing problem with stochastic service requests, an important problem in city-based logistics. We contribute to the routing literature as well as to the field of ADP. We combine offline value function approximation (VFA) with online rollout algorithms resulting in a high-quality, computationally tractable policy. Our offline–online policy enhances the anticipation of the VFA policy, yielding spatial and temporal anticipation of requests and routing developments. Our combination of VFA with rollout algorithms demonstrates the potential benefit of using ..."}
