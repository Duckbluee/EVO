{"abstract":"Despite recent advances in the field of explainability, much remains unknown about the algorithms that neural networks learn to represent. Recent work has attempted to understand trained models by decomposing them into functional circuits (Csord\\'as et al., 2020; Lepori et al., 2023). To advance this research, we developed NeuroSurgeon, a python library that can be used to discover and manipulate subnetworks within models in the Huggingface Transformers library (Wolf et al., 2019). NeuroSurgeon is freely available at https://github.com/mlepori1/NeuroSurgeon."}
