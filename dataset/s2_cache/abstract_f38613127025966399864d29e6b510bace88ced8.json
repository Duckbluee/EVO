{"abstract":"RNA-protein interactions (RPIs) play an important role in several fundamental cellular physiological processes, including cell motility, chromosome replication, transcription and translation, and signaling. Predicting RPI can guide the exploration of cellular biological functions, intervening in diseases, and designing drugs. Given this, this study proposes the RPI-gated graph convolutional network (RPI-GGCN) method for predicting RPI based on the gated graph convolutional neural network (GGCN) and co-regularized variational autoencoder (Co-VAE). First, different types of feature information were extracted from RNA and protein sequences by nine feature extraction methods. Second, Co-VAEs are used to eliminate the redundancy of fused features and generate optimal features. Finally, this study introduces gated cyclic units into graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to construct a model for RPI prediction, which efficiently extracts topological information and improves the model’s interpretable feature learning and expression capabilities. In the fivefold cross-validation test, the RPI-GGCN method achieved prediction accuracies of 97.27%, 97.32%, 96.54%, 95.76%, and 94.98% on the RPI369, RPI488, RPI1446, RPI1807, and RPI2241 datasets. To test the generalization performance of the model, we used the model trained on RPI369 to predict the independent NPInter v3.0 dataset and achieved excellent performance in all six independent validation sets. By visualizing the RPI network graph based on the prediction results, we aim to provide a new perspective and reference for studying RPI mechanisms and exploring new RPIs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RPI-GGCN can provide an efficient, accurate, and stable RPI prediction method."}
