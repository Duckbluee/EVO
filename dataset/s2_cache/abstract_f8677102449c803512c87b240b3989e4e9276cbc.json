{"abstract":"This Review identifies challenges and research frontiers in learning techniques to advance adaptive robot manipulation skills. The ever-changing nature of human environments presents great challenges to robot manipulation. Objects that robots must manipulate vary in shape, weight, and configuration. Important properties of the robot, such as surface friction and motor torque constants, also vary over time. Before robot manipulators can work gracefully in homes and businesses, they must be adaptive to such variations. This survey summarizes types of variations that robots may encounter in human environments and categorizes, compares, and contrasts the ways in which learning has been applied to manipulation problems through the lens of adaptability. Promising avenues for future research are proposed at the end."}
