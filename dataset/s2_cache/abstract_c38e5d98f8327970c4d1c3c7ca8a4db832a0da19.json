{"abstract":"Nowadays, billions of phones, internet-of-things (IoT), and edge devices around the world generate data continuously, enabling many machine-learning (ML)-based products and applications. However, due to increasing privacy concerns and regulations, these data tend to reside on devices (clients) instead of being centralized for performing traditional ML model training. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed approach in which a single server and multiple clients collaboratively build an ML model without moving data away from clients. Whereas existing studies on FL have their own experimental evaluations, most experiments were conducted using a simulation setting or a small-scale testbed. This might limit the understanding of FL implementation in realistic environments. In this empirical study, we systematically conduct extensive experiments on a large network of IoT and edge devices (called IoT–Edge devices) to present FL real-world characteristics, including learning performance and operation (computation and communication) costs. Moreover, we mainly concentrate on heterogeneous scenarios, which is the most challenging issue of FL. By investigating the feasibility of on-device implementation, our study provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, promoting the practicality of FL and assisting in improving the current design of real FL systems."}
