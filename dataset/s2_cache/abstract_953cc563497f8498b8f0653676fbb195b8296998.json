{"abstract":"Federated learning is a popular distributed machine learning paradigm with enhanced privacy. Its primary goal is learning a global model that offers good performance for the participants as many as possible. The technology is rapidly advancing with many unsolved challenges, among which statistical heterogeneity (i.e., non-IID) and communication efficiency are two critical ones that hinder the development of federated learning. In this work, we propose LotteryFL -- a personalized and communication-efficient federated learning framework via exploiting the Lottery Ticket hypothesis. In LotteryFL, each client learns a lottery ticket network (i.e., a subnetwork of the base model) by applying the Lottery Ticket hypothesis, and only these lottery networks will be communicated between the server and clients. Rather than learning a shared global model in classic federated learning, each client learns a personalized model via LotteryFL; the communication cost can be significantly reduced due to the compact size of lottery networks. To support the training and evaluation of our framework, we construct non-IID datasets based on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and EMNIST by taking feature distribution skew, label distribution skew and quantity skew into consideration. Experiments on these non-IID datasets demonstrate that LotteryFL significantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of personalization and communication cost."}
