{"abstract":"The task of company classification is traditionally performed using established standards, such as the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). However, these approaches heavily rely on laborious manual efforts by domain experts, resulting in slow, costly, and vendor-specific assignments. Therefore, we investigate recent natural language processing (NLP) advancements to automate the company classification process. In particular, we employ and evaluate various NLP-based models, including zero-shot learning, One-vs-Rest classification, multi-class classifiers, and ChatGPT-aided classification. We conduct a comprehensive comparison among these models to assess their effectiveness in the company classification task. The evaluation uses the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) dataset, consisting of textual descriptions of publicly traded companies. Our findings reveal that the RoBERTa and One-vs-Rest classifiers surpass the other methods, achieving F1 scores of 0.81 and 0.80 on the WRDS dataset, respectively. These results demonstrate that deep learning algorithms offer the potential to automate, standardize, and continuously update classification systems in an efficient and cost-effective way. In addition, we introduce several improvements to the multi-class classification techniques: (1) in the zero-shot methodology, we TF-IDF to enhance sector representation, yielding improved accuracy in comparison to standard zero-shot classifiers; (2) next, we use ChatGPT for dataset generation, revealing potential in scenarios where datasets of company descriptions are lacking; and (3) we also employ K-Fold to reduce noise in the WRDS dataset, followed by conducting experiments to assess the impact of noise reduction on the company classification results."}
