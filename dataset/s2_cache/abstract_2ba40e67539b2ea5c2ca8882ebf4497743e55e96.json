{"abstract":"Tabular data is hard to acquire and is subject to missing values. This paper introduces a novel approach for generating and imputing mixed-type (continuous and categorical) tabular data utilizing score-based diffusion and conditional flow matching. In contrast to prior methods that rely on neural networks to learn the score function or the vector field, we adopt XGBoost, a widely used Gradient-Boosted Tree (GBT) technique. To test our method, we build one of the most extensive benchmarks for tabular data generation and imputation, containing 27 diverse datasets and 9 metrics. Through empirical evaluation across the benchmark, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms deep-learning generation methods in data generation tasks and remains competitive in data imputation. Notably, it can be trained in parallel using CPUs without requiring a GPU. Our Python and R code is available at https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/ForestDiffusion."}
