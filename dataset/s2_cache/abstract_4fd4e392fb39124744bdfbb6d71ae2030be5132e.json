{"abstract":"We introduce the first work to explore web-scale diffusion models for robotics. DALL-E-Bot enables a robot to rearrange objects in a scene, by first inferring a text description of those objects, then generating an image representing a natural, human-like arrangement of those objects, and finally physically arranging the objects according to that goal image. We show that this is possible zero-shot using DALL-E, without needing any further example arrangements, data collection, or training. DALL-E-Bot is fully autonomous and is not restricted to a pre-defined set of objects or scenes, thanks to DALL-E's web-scale pre-training. Encouraging real-world results, with both human studies and objective metrics, show that integrating web-scale diffusion models into robotics pipelines is a promising direction for scalable, unsupervised robot learning."}
