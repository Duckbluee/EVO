{"abstract":"The clinical research industry today is undergoing a major facelift. Companies are continuously looking to adopt and implement effective and innovative ways to accelerate drug launches in the market. Companies today are more open and do not view patients as mere “subjects” who generate data, – but as informed collaborators whose participation is “core” to the overall success of trials leading to the emergence of the concept of “patient-centric trials.” This paper is intended to highlight the current trends and new opportunities that can be seen in industry -indicative of crucial role patients today play in their own health care using technology, social media and self education."}
