{"abstract":"'Actions' play a vital role in how humans interact with the world and enable them to achieve desired goals. As a result, most common sense (CS) knowledge for humans revolves around actions. While 'Reasoning about Actions&Change' (RAC) has been widely studied in the Knowledge Representation community, it has recently piqued the interest of NLP and computer vision researchers. This paper surveys existing tasks, benchmark datasets, various techniques and models, and their respective performance concerning advancements in RAC in the vision and language domain. Towards the end, we summarize our key takeaways, discuss the present challenges facing this research area, and outline potential directions for future research."}
