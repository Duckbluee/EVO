{"abstract":"In this paper, we proposed a deep neural network to predict the Thailand stock market (SET index) with the capability to analyze both numerical and textual inputs altogether. The datasets include twelve-years market data with generated technical indicators (73 time-series) and Thai economic news headlines from various online sources. The proposed model consists of a long-short term memory model and textual representations to predict one-day-ahead percentage market changes. We experiment on two textual representation approaches, which is the Hierarchical neural network and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) together with aggregated embedding. The three-year average experimental results show that adding textual representation increase profit of 6.9% on the proposed strategy-free metric. Next, the Hierarchical approach performs considerably better than the BERT method showing up to 4.4% profit increase. Finally, we demonstrate another advantage of the hierarchical approach for model interpretability using the integrated gradient attribution methods. This interpretability lets us analyze the underlying textual relevance and also for future model improvement."}
