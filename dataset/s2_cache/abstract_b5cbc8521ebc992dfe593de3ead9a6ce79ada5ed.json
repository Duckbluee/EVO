{"abstract":"Among the inherent problems in recommendation systems are data sparseness and cold starts; the solutions to which lie in the introduction of knowledge graphs to improve the performance of the recommendation systems. The results in previous research, however, suffer from problems such as data compression, information damage, and insufficient learning. Therefore, a DeepFM Graph Convolutional Network (DFM-GCN) model was proposed to alleviate the above issues. The prediction of the click-through rate (CTR) is critical in recommendation systems where the task is to estimate the probability that a user will click on a recommended item. In many recommendation systems, the goal is to maximize the number of clicks so the items returned to a user can be ranked by an estimated CTR. The DFM-GCN model consists of three parts: the left part DeepFM is used to capture the interactive information between the users and items; the deep neural network is used in the middle to model the left and right parts; and the right one obtains a better item representation vector by the GCN. In an effort to verify the validity and precision of the model built in this research, and based on the public datasets ml1m-kg20m and ml1m-kg1m, a performance comparison experiment was designed. It used multiple comparison models and the MKR and FM_MKR algorithms as well as the DFM-GCN algorithm constructed in this paper. Having achieved a state-of-the-art performance, the experimental results of the AUC and f1 values verified by the CTR as well as the accuracy, recall, and f1 values of the top-k showed that the proposed approach was excellent and more effective when compared with different recommendation algorithms."}
