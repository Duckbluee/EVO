{"abstract":"Glass beads were among the most common grave goods in the Early Middle Ages, with an estimated number in the millions. The color, size, shape and decoration of the beads are diverse leading to many different archaeological classification systems that depend on the subjective decisions of individual experts. The lack of an agreed upon expert categorization leads to a pressing problem in archaeology, as the categorization of archaeological artifacts, like glass beads, is important to learn about cultural trends, manufacturing processes or economic relationships (e.g., trade routes) of historical times. An automated, objective and reproducible classification system is therefore highly desirable. We present a high-quality data set of images of Early Medieval beads and propose a clustering pipeline to learn a classification system in a data-driven way. The pipeline consists of a novel extension of deep embedded non-redundant clustering to identify multiple, meaningful clusterings of glass bead images. During the cluster analysis we address several challenges associated with the data and as a result identify high-quality clusterings that overlap with archaeological domain expertise. To the best of our knowledge this is the first application of non-redundant image clustering for archaeological data."}
