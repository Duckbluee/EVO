{"abstract":"Many recent studies in procedural content generation (PCG) are based on machine learning. One of the promising approaches is generative models, which have shown impressive results in generating new pictures and videos from existing ones. However, it is usually costly to collect sufficient content for training on PCG. To address this issue, we consider reinforcement learning (RL), which does not need to collect training data in advance but learns from its interaction with an environment. In this work, RL agents are trained to generate stages, which we define as series of events in turn-based role playing games. It is a challenging task since several events in a stage are usually highly correlated to each other. We first formulate the stage generation problem into a Markov decision process. A hand-crafted evaluation function, which simulates players’ enjoyment, is defined to evaluate generated stages. Two RL algorithms are selected in the experiments, which are deep Q-network for discrete action space and deep deterministic policy gradient for continuous action space. The generated stages from both models receive evaluation values indicating good quality. To solve the delayed reward problem and further improve the quality of the stages, we employ virtual simulations (VS) to give rewards to intermediate actions and get stages with higher average scores. In addition, we introduce noise to avoid generating similar stages while trying to keep the quality as high as possible. The proposed methods succeed in generating good and diverse stages."}
