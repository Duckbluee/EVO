{"abstract":"The prosperity of machine learning has been accompanied by increasing attacks on the training process. Among them, poisoning attacks have become an emerging threat during model training. Poisoning attacks have profound impacts on the target models, e.g., making them unable to converge or manipulating their prediction results. Moreover, the rapid development of recent distributed learning frameworks, especially federated learning, has further stimulated the development of poisoning attacks. Defending against poisoning attacks is challenging and urgent. However, the systematic review from a unified perspective remains blank. This survey provides an in-depth and up-to-date overview of poisoning attacks and corresponding countermeasures in both centralized and federated learning. We firstly categorize attack methods based on their goals. Secondly, we offer detailed analysis of the differences and connections among the attack techniques. Furthermore, we present countermeasures in different learning framework and highlight their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss the reasons for the feasibility of poisoning attacks and address the potential research directions from attacks and defenses perspectives, separately."}
