{"abstract":"Text image, the one with its content dominated by text, is a common type of images seen in many applications. In practice, text images are often degraded by many factors mixed together. This article aims at recovering degraded text images that suffer from the mixture of multiple degradations, including low resolution, uniform blurring and noise. It is observed that such mixed degradations treat the low-frequency components and high-frequency components of an image in different manners, and the emphasis of recovery is on predicting high-frequency information. Motivated by such an observation, we proposed a neural network that collaboratively works on the prediction of high-frequency information and the recovery of text image with both low and high frequencies. The experiments are conducted on one existing benchmark dataset of document images and one new dataset covering a wide range of text images. The results show that the proposed method noticeably outperformed the existing ones."}
