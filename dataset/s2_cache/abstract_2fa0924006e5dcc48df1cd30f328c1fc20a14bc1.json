{"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new framework called Privacy Preserving Proxy (PPP) to protect the online models. PPP is designed like a gateway to work on behalf of the users when requesting service, potentially masking the true origin of the online model from client. Instead of connecting directly to the machine learning-as-a-service(MLaaS) the clients submit the request to the PPP, which evaluates the request and executes some functions to maximize the safety of the models. PPP can potentially host a wide range of functions or triggers to control the complexity of the request or provide additional benefits such as privacy and security. We propose two different methods including Random Model Assignment and Intelligent Rounding Policy which can function inside PPP to protect the privacy of online models. To test the PPP we test TL-GAN based face reconstruction attack as a sophisticated approach which can reveal inefficiency of rounding policy as countermeasure. Our experiments show that, PPP can potentially nullify such complicated attacks in the future."}
