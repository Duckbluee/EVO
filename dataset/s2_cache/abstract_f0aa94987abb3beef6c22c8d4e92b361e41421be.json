{"abstract":"Recent deep networks have convincingly demonstrated high capability in crowd counting, which is a critical task attracting widespread attention due to its various industrial applications. Despite such progress, trained data-dependent models usually can not generalize well to unseen scenarios because of the inherent domain shift. To facilitate this issue, this paper proposes a novel adversarial scoring network (ASNet) to gradually bridge the gap across domains from coarse to fine granularity. In specific, at the coarse-grained stage, we design a dual-discriminator strategy to adapt source domain to be close to the targets from the perspectives of both global and local feature space via adversarial learning. The distributions between two domains can thus be aligned roughly. At the fine-grained stage, we explore the transferability of source characteristics by scoring how similar the source samples are to target ones from multiple levels based on generative probability derived from coarse stage. Guided by these hierarchical scores, the transferable source features are properly selected to enhance the knowledge transfer during the adaptation process. With the coarse-to-fine design, the generalization bottleneck induced from the domain discrepancy can be effectively alleviated. Three sets of migration experiments show that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art counting performance compared with major unsupervised methods."}
