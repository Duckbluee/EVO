{"abstract":"Determining whether given video frames contain violent content is a basic problem in violence detection. Visual and audio information are useful for detecting violence included in a video, and are usually complementary; however, violence detection studies focusing on fusing visual and audio information are relatively rare. Therefore, we explored methods for fusing visual and audio information. We proposed a neural network containing three modules for fusing multimodal information: 1) attention module for utilizing weighted features to generate effective features based on the mutual guidance between visual and audio information; 2) fusion module for integrating features by fusing visual and audio information based on the bilinear pooling mechanism; and 3) mutual Learning module for enabling the model to learn visual information from another neural network with a different architecture. Experimental results indicated that the proposed neural network outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the XD-Violence dataset."}
