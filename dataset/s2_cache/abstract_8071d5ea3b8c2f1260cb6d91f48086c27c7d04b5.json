{"abstract":"Source-free domain adaptation has become popular because of its practical usefulness and no need to access source data. However, the adaptation process still takes a considerable amount of time and is predominantly based on optimization that relies on back-propagation. In this work we present a simple feed-forward approach that challenges the need for back-propagation based adaptation. Our approach is based on computing prototypes of classes under the domain shift using a pre-trained model. It achieves strong improvements in accuracy compared to the pre-trained model and requires only a small fraction of time of existing domain adaptation methods."}
