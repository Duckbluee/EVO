{"abstract":"With growing concern of data privacy violations, privacy preservation processes become more intense. The k-anonymity method, a widely applied technique, transforms the data such that the publishing datasets must have at least k tuples to have the same link-able attribute, quasi-identifiers, values. From the observations, we found that, in a certain domain, all quasi-identifiers of the datasets, can have the same data type. This type of attribute is considered as an Identical Generalization Hierarchy (IGH) data. An IGH data has a particular set of characteristics that could utilize for enhancing the efficiency of heuristic privacy preservation algorithms. In this paper, we propose a data privacy preservation heuristic algorithm on IGH data. The algorithm is developed from the observations on the anonymous property of the problem structure that can eliminate the privacy constraints consideration. The experiment results are presented that the proposed algorithm could effectively preserve data privacy and also reduce the number of visited nodes for ensuring the privacy protection, which is the most time-consuming process, compared to the most efficient existing algorithm by at most 21%."}
