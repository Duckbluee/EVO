{"abstract":"Summary\nA structural database of peptide-protein interactions is important for drug discovery targeting peptide-mediated interactions. Although some peptide databases, especially for special types of peptides, have been developed, a comprehensive database of cleaned peptide-protein complex structures is still not available. Such cleaned structures are valuable for docking and scoring studies in structure-based drug design. Here, we have developed PepBDB-a curated Peptide Binding DataBase of biological complex structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). PepBDB presents not only cleaned structures but also extensive information about biological peptide-protein interactions, and allows users to search the database with a variety of options and interactively visualize the search results.\n\n\nAvailability and implementation\nPepBDB is available at http://huanglab.phys.hust.edu.cn/pepbdb/."}
