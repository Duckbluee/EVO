{"abstract":"In recent years, side channel attacks (SCA) have become the most powerful method of stealing keys from cryptographic devices. This paper establishes a complete process of electromagnetic analysis attack based on correlation between energy traces and intermediate data in AES encryption algorithm. A novel method of preprocessing energy traces, which combines wavelet reconstruction with low-pass filtering, is proposed to enhance the capability to obtain correct key information of AES. Correlation-based power analysis attack (CPA) and electromagnetic analysis attack (CEMA) are implemented on the unprotected AES encryption circuit in the SAKURA-G FPGA board. The results clearly show that only 972 and 1069 energy traces are required to find all 16-byte keys. With only collecting 200 traces, CEMA presents more efficient attack capability than CPA. Thus, our proposed method is appropriate for obtaining key information of cryptographic devices."}
