{"abstract":"Making digital evidence presentable is hard due to the intangible and complex nature of digital evidence and the variety of targeted audiences. In this paper, we present Digital Forensic Knowledge Graph (DFKG) for visualizing and reasoning about digital forensic evidence. We first describe the criteria of presentable evidence to ensure authenticity, integrity, validity, credibility, and relevance of evidence. Then we specify DFKG to capture presentable forensic evidence from three perspectives: (1) the background of a criminal case, (2) the reconstructed timeline of a criminal case, and (3) the verifiable digital evidence related to the criminal activity timeline. We also present a case study to illustrate the DFKG-based approach."}
