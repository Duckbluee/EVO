{"abstract":"Big data is a rapidly growing field, and new developments are constantly emerging to address various challenges. One such development is the use of federated learning for recommendation systems (FRSs). An FRS provides a way to protect user privacy by training recommendation models using intermediate parameters instead of real user data. This approach allows for cooperation between data platforms while still complying with privacy regulations. In this paper, we explored the current state of research on FRSs, highlighting existing research issues and possible solutions. Specifically, we looked at how FRSs can be used to protect user privacy while still allowing organizations to benefit from the data they share. Additionally, we examined potential applications of FRSs in the context of big data, exploring how these systems can be used to facilitate secure data sharing and collaboration. Finally, we discuss the challenges associated with developing and deploying FRSs in the real world and how these challenges can be addressed."}
