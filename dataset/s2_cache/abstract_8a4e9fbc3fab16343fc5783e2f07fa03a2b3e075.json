{"abstract":"Mining and analysing streaming data is crucial for many applications, and this area of research has gained extensive attention over the past decade. However, there are several inherent problems that continue to challenge the hardware and the state-of-the art algorithmic solutions. Examples of such problems include the unbound size, varying speed and unknown data characteristics of arriving instances from a data stream. The aim of this research is to portray key challenges faced by algorithmic solutions for stream mining, particularly focusing on the prevalent issue of concept drift. A comprehensive discussion of concept drift and its inherent data challenges in the context of stream mining is presented, as is a critical, in-depth review of relevant literature. Current issues with the evaluative procedure for concept drift detectors is also explored, highlighting problems such as a lack of established base datasets and the impact of temporal dependence on concept drift detection. By exposing gaps in the current literature, this study suggests recommendations for future research which should aid in the progression of stream mining and concept drift detection algorithms."}
