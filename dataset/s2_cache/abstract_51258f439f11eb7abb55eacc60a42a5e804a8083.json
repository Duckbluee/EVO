{"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce 3rd place solution for PVUW2023 VSS track. Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision with numerous real-world applications. We have explored various image-level visual backbones and segmentation heads to tackle the problem of video semantic segmentation. Through our experimentation, we find that InternImage-H as the backbone and Mask2former as the segmentation head achieves the best performance. In addition, we explore two post-precessing methods: CascadePSP and Segment Anything Model (SAM). Ultimately, our approach obtains 62.60\\% and 64.84\\% mIoU on the VSPW test set1 and final test set, respectively, securing the third position in the PVUW2023 VSS track."}
