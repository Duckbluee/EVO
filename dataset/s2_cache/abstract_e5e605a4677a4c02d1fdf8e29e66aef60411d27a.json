{"abstract":"Knowledge graphs, representation of information as a semantic graph, have caused wide concern in both industrial and academic world. Their property of providing semantically structured information has brought important possible solutions for many tasks including question answering, recommendation and information retrieval, and is considered to offer great promise for building more intelligent machines by many researchers. Although knowledge graphs have already supported multiple “Big Data” applications in all sorts of commercial and scientific domains since Google coined this term in 2012, there was no previous study give a systemically review of the application of knowledge graphs. Therefore, unlike other related work which focuses on the construction techniques of knowledge graphs, this present paper aims at providing a first survey on these applications stemming from different domains. This paper also points out that while important advancements of applying knowledge graphs’ great ability of providing semantically structured information into specific domains have been made in recent years, several aspects still remain to be explored."}
