{"abstract":"The rapid development of modern communication technologies—in particular, (mobile) phone communications—has largely facilitated human social interactions and information exchange. However, the emergence of telemarketing frauds can significantly dissipate individual fortune and social wealth, resulting in a potential slow down or damage to economics. In this work, we propose to spot telemarketing frauds, with an emphasis on unveiling the “<italic>precise fraud</italic>” phenomenon and the strategies that are used by fraudsters to precisely select targets. To study this problem, we employ a one-month complete dataset of telecommunication metadata in Shanghai with 54 million users and 698 million call logs. Through our study, we find that user's information might have been seriously leaked, and fraudsters have a preference over the target user's age and activity in mobile network. We further propose a novel semi-supervised learning framework to distinguish fraudsters from non-fraudsters. Experimental results on a real-world data show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms in accuracy of detecting fraudsters (e.g., <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$+0.278$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>278</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"xu-ieq1-2924431.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> in terms of F1 on average). We believe that our study can potentially inform policymaking for government and mobile service providers."}
