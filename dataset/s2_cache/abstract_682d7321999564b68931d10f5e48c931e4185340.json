{"abstract":"This paper introduces a new system to design constructive level generators by searching the space of constructive level generators defined by Marahel language. We use NSGA-II, a multi-objective optimization algorithm, to search for generators for three different problems (Binary, Zelda, and Sokoban). We restrict the representation to a subset of Marahel language to push the evolution to find more efficient generators. The results show that the generated generators were able to achieve good performance on most of the fitness functions over these three problems. However, on Zelda and Sokoban they tend to depend on the initial state than modifying the map."}
