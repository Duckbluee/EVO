{"abstract":"Healthcare is very important to lead a good life. However, it is very difficult to obtain the consultation with the doctor for every health problem. The idea is to create a medical chatbot using Artificial Intelligence that can diagnose the disease and provide basic details about the disease before consulting a doctor. This will help to reduce healthcare costs and improve accessibility to medical knowledge through medical chatbot. The chatbots are computer programs that use natural language to interact with users. The chatbot stores the data in the database to identify the sentence keywords and to make a query decision and answer the question. Ranking and sentence similarity calculation is performed using n-gram, TFIDF and cosine similarity. The score will be obtained for each sentence from the given input sentence and more similar sentences will be obtained for the query given. The third party, the expert program, handles the question presented to the bot that is not understood or is not present in the database."}
