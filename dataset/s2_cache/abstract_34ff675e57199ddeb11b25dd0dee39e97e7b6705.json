{"abstract":"This article provides a state-of-the-art summary of location privacy issues and geoprivacy-preserving methods in public health interventions and health research involving disaggregate geographic data about individuals. Synthetic data generation (from real data using machine learning) is discussed in detail as a promising privacy-preserving approach. To fully achieve their goals, privacy-preserving methods should form part of a wider comprehensive socio-technical framework for the appropriate disclosure, use and dissemination of data containing personal identifiable information. Select highlights are also presented from a related December 2021 AAG (American Association of Geographers) webinar that explored ethical and other issues surrounding the use of geospatial data to address public health issues during challenging crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic."}
