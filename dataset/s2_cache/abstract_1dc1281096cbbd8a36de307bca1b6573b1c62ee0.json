{"abstract":"Recently, the advancement of deep learning (DL) in discriminative feature learning from 3-D LiDAR data has led to rapid development in the field of autonomous driving. However, automated processing uneven, unstructured, noisy, and massive 3-D point clouds are a challenging and tedious task. In this article, we provide a systematic review of existing compelling DL architectures applied in LiDAR point clouds, detailing for specific tasks in autonomous driving, such as segmentation, detection, and classification. Although several published research articles focus on specific topics in computer vision for autonomous vehicles, to date, no general survey on DL applied in LiDAR point clouds for autonomous vehicles exists. Thus, the goal of this article is to narrow the gap in this topic. More than 140 key contributions in the recent five years are summarized in this survey, including the milestone 3-D deep architectures, the remarkable DL applications in 3-D semantic segmentation, object detection, and classification; specific data sets, evaluation metrics, and the state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we conclude the remaining challenges and future researches."}
