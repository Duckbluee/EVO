{"abstract":"Medical vision-and-language pre-training provides a feasible solution to extract effective vision-and-language representations from medical images and texts. However, few studies have been dedicated to this field to facilitate medical vision-and-language understanding. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning paradigm with multi-modal masked autoencoders (M$^3$AE), which learn cross-modal domain knowledge by reconstructing missing pixels and tokens from randomly masked images and texts. There are three key designs to make this simple approach work. First, considering the different information densities of vision and language, we adopt different masking ratios for the input image and text, where a considerably larger masking ratio is used for images. Second, we use visual and textual features from different layers to perform the reconstruction to deal with different levels of abstraction in visual and language. Third, we develop different designs for vision and language decoders (i.e., a Transformer for vision and a multi-layer perceptron for language). To perform a comprehensive evaluation and facilitate further research, we construct a medical vision-and-language benchmark including three tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, where state-of-the-art results are achieved on all downstream tasks. Besides, we conduct further analysis to better verify the effectiveness of different components of our approach and various settings of pre-training.
