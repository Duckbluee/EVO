{"abstract":"Recommender systems, which aim to suggest personalized lists of items for users, have drawn a lot of attention. In fact, many of these state-of-the-art recommender systems have been built on deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent studies have shown that these deep neural networks are vulnerable to attacks, such as data poisoning, which generate fake users to promote a selected set of items. Correspondingly, effective defense strategies have been developed to detect these generated users with fake profiles. Thus, new strategies of creating more ‘realistic’ user profiles to promote a set of items should be investigated to further understand the vulnerability of DNNs based recommender systems. In this work, we present a novel framework CopyAttack. It is a reinforcement learning based black-box attacking method that harnesses real users from a source domain by copying their profiles into the target domain with the goal of promoting a subset of items. CopyAttack is constructed to both efficiently and effectively learn policy gradient networks that first select, then further refine/craft user profiles from the source domain, and ultimately copy them into the target domain. CopyAttack’s goal is to maximize the hit ratio of the targeted items in the Top-k recommendation list of the users in the target domain. We conducted experiments on two real-world datasets and empirically verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The implementation of CopyAttack is available at https://github.com/wenqifan03/CopyAttack."}
