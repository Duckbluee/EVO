{"abstract":"Continual learning is crucial for dialog state tracking (DST) in dialog systems, since requirements from users for new functionalities are often encountered. However, most of existing continual learning methods for DST require task identities during testing, which is a severe limit in real-world applications. In this paper, we aim to address continual learning of DST in the class-incremental scenario (namely the task identity is unknown in testing). Inspired by the recently emerging prompt tuning method that performs well on dialog systems, we propose to use the prompt pool method, where we maintain a pool of key-value paired prompts and select prompts from the pool according to the distance between the dialog history and the prompt keys. The proposed method can automatically identify tasks and select appropriate prompts during testing. We conduct experiments on Schema-Guided Dialog dataset (SGD) and another dataset collected from a real-world dialog application. Experiment results show that the prompt pool method achieves much higher joint goal accuracy than the baseline. After combining with a rehearsal buffer, the model performance can be further improved."}
