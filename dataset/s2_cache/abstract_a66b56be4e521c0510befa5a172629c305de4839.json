{"abstract":"Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have sparked interest in the parallels between large language models (LLMs) and human neural processing, particularly in language comprehension. Although previous research has demonstrated similarities between LLM representations and neural responses, the computational principles driving this convergence—especially as LLMs evolve—remain elusive. Here we used intracranial electroencephalography recordings from neurosurgical patients listening to speech to investigate the alignment between high-performance LLMs and the language-processing mechanisms of the brain. We examined a diverse selection of LLMs with similar parameter sizes and found that as their performance on benchmark tasks improves, they not only become more brain-like, reflected in better neural response predictions from model embeddings, but they also align more closely with the hierarchical feature extraction pathways of the brain, using fewer layers for the same encoding. Additionally, we identified commonalities in the hierarchical processing mechanisms of high-performing LLMs, revealing their convergence towards similar language-processing strategies. Finally, we demonstrate the critical role of contextual information in both LLM performance and brain alignment. These findings reveal converging aspects of language processing in the brain and LLMs, offering new directions for developing models that better align with human cognitive processing. Why brain-like feature extraction emerges in large language models (LLMs) remains elusive. Mischler, Li and colleagues demonstrate that high-performing LLMs not only predict neural responses more accurately than other LLMs but also align more closely with the hierarchical language processing pathway in the brain, revealing parallels between these models and human cognitive mechanisms."}
