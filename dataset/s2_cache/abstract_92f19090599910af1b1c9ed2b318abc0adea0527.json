{"abstract":"As a natural language assistant, ChatGPT is capable of performing various tasks, including but not limited to article generation, code completion, and data analysis. Furthermore, ChatGPT has consistently demonstrated a remarkable level of accuracy and reliability in terms of content evaluation, exhibiting the capability of mimicking human preferences. To further explore ChatGPT's potential in this regard, a study is conducted to assess its ability to rank content. In order to do so, a test set consisting of prompts is created, covering a wide range of use cases, and five models are utilized to generate corresponding responses. ChatGPT is then instructed to rank the responses generated by these models. The results on the test set show that ChatGPT's ranking preferences are consistent with human to a certain extent. This preliminary experimental finding implies that ChatGPT's zero-shot ranking capability could be used to reduce annotation pressure in a number of ranking tasks."}
