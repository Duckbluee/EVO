{"abstract":"The large volume of open data on the Web is expected to be reused and create value. Finding the right data to reuse is a non-trivial task addressed by the recent dataset search systems, which retrieve datasets relevant to a keyword query. An important component of such systems is snippet generation, extracting data from a retrieved dataset to exemplify its content and explain its relevance to the query. Snippet generation algorithms have emerged but were mainly evaluated by user studies. More efficient and reproducible evaluation methods are needed. To meet this challenge, in this article, we present a set of quality metrics for assessing the usefulness of a snippet from different perspectives, and we select and aggregate them into quality profiles for different stages of a dataset search process. Furthermore, we create a benchmark from thousands of collected real-world data needs and datasets, on which we apply the presented quality metrics and profiles to evaluate snippets generated by two existing algorithms and three adapted algorithms. The results, which are reproducible as they are automatically computed without human interaction, show the pros and cons of the tested algorithms and highlight directions for future research. The benchmark data is publicly available."}
