{"abstract":"Visual emotion expression plays an important role in audiovisual speech communication. In this work, we propose a novel approach to rendering visual emotion expression in speech-driven talking face generation. Specifically, we design an end-to-end talking face generation system that takes a speech utterance, a single face image, and a categorical emotion label as input to render a talking face video synchronized with the speech and expressing the conditioned emotion. Objective evaluation on image quality, audiovisual synchronization, and visual emotion expression shows that the proposed system outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline system. Subjective evaluation of visual emotion expression and video realness also demonstrates the superiority of the proposed system. Furthermore, we conduct a human emotion recognition pilot study using generated videos with mismatched emotions among the audio and visual modalities. Results show that humans respond to the visual modality more significantly than the audio modality on this task."}
