{"abstract":"This paper introduces the Meshroom software and its underlying 3D computer vision framework AliceVision. This solution provides a photogrammetry pipeline to reconstruct 3D scenes from a set of unordered images. It also features other pipelines for fusing multi-bracketing low dynamic range images into high dynamic range, stitching multiple images into a panorama and estimating the motion of a moving camera. Meshroom's node-graph architecture allows the user to customize the different pipelines to adjust them to their domain specific needs. The user can interactively add other processing nodes to modify a pipeline, export intermediate data to analyze the result of the algorithms and easily compare the outputs given by different sets of parameters. The software package is released in open source and relies on open file formats. These features enable researchers to conveniently run the pipelines, access and visualize the data at each step, thus promoting the sharing and the reproducibility of the results."}
