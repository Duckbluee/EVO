{"abstract":"Due to privacy concerns and data transmission issues, Source-free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFDA) has gained popularity. It exploits pre-trained source models, rather than raw source data for target learning, to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Existing methods solve this problem typically with additional parameters or noisy pseudo labels, and we propose an effective method named Proxy-based Mixup training with label refinery (ProxyMix) to avoid these drawbacks. To avoid additional parameters and leverages information in the source model, ProxyMix defines classifier weights as class prototypes and creates a class-balanced proxy source domain using nearest neighbors of the prototypes. To improve the reliability of pseudo labels, we further propose the frequency-weighted aggregation strategy to generate soft pseudo labels for unlabeled target data. Our strategy utilizes target features' internal structure, increases weights of low-frequency class samples, and aligns the proxy and target domains using inter- and intra-domain mixup regularization. This mitigates the negative impact of noisy labels. Experiments on three 2D image and 3D point cloud object recognition benchmarks demonstrate that ProxyMix yields state-of-the-art performance for source-free UDA tasks."}
