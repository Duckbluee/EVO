{"abstract":"\n This book recounts the fascinating story of the runic script, using runic inscriptions to trace some of the major events to shape the medieval North, from migration, settlement, and conquest to conversion and the emergence of Old English and Norse literary traditions. Emerging from obscure origins early in the first millennium, the runic script evolved into an important means of written communication in early medieval England and Viking Age Scandinavia, bearing witness to changing faiths, documenting the exploits of Norse settlers and mercenaries as they redrew the map of Europe, and providing a rare window into the everyday lives of medieval merchants. From salacious graffiti and intimate inscriptions on jewellery to towering runestones expressing the power and prestige of Viking rulers, the history told through runic objects offers a rare insight into cultures on the peripheries of Europe as they came to shape the medieval world. Through six chapters focused on distinct periods in the history of runes, the book introduces readers to some of the highlights of the runic corpus, including exciting objects only discovered in the last few years. Runes have come to increasing prominence through adaptations of Tolkien’s fiction for the screen, their use in video games, and their appropriation by the extreme right. This complex legacy of the reception and misuse of runes is an important facet of the cultural history of the script, and the final chapter brings the story of runes into the twenty-first century by addressing these many modern afterlives."}
