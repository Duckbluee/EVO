{"abstract":"Based on interviews with 28 organizations, we found that industry practitioners are not equipped with tactical and strategic tools to protect, detect and respond to attacks on their Machine Learning (ML) systems. We leverage the insights from the interviews and enumerate the gaps in securing machine learning systems when viewed in the context of traditional software security development. We write this paper from the perspective of two personas: developers/ML engineers and security incident responders. The goal of this paper is to layout the research agenda to amend the Security Development Lifecycle for industrial-grade software in the adversarial ML era."}
