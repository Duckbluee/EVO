{"abstract":"Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) are expressive generative models that have been used to solve a variety of speech synthesis problems. However, because of their high sampling costs, DDPMs are difficult to use in real-time speech processing applications. In this paper, we introduce DiffGAN-TTS, a novel DDPM-based text-to-speech (TTS) model achieving high-fidelity and efficient speech synthesis. DiffGAN-TTS is based on denoising diffusion generative adversarial networks (GANs), which adopt an adversarially-trained expressive model to approximate the denoising distribution. We show with multi-speaker TTS experiments that DiffGAN-TTS can generate high-fidelity speech samples within only 4 denoising steps. We present an active shallow diffusion mechanism to further speed up inference. A two-stage training scheme is proposed, with a basic TTS acoustic model trained at stage one providing valuable prior information for a DDPM trained at stage two. Our experiments show that DiffGAN-TTS can achieve high synthesis performance with only 1 denoising step."}
