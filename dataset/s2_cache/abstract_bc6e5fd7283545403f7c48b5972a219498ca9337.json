{"abstract":"Patent application is one of the important ways to protect innovation achievements that have great commercial value for enterprises; it is the initial step for enterprises to set the business development track, as well as a powerful means to protect their core competitiveness. The emergence of a large amount of patent data makes the effective detection of patent data difficult, and patent infringement cases occur frequently. Manual measurement in patent detection is slow, costly, and subjective, and can only play an auxiliary role in measuring the validity of patents. Protecting the inventive achievements of patent holders and realizing more accurate and effective patent detection were the issues explored by academics. There are five main methods to measure patent similarity: clustering-based method, vector space model (VSM)-based method, subject–action–object (SAO) structure-based method, deep learning-based method, and patent structure-based method. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a calculation method to fuse the similarity of patent text and image. Firstly, the SAO structure extraction technique is used for the patent text to obtain the effective content of the text, and the SAO structure is compared for similarity; secondly, the patent image information is extracted and compared; finally, the patent similarity is obtained by fusing the two aspects of information. The feasibility and effectiveness of the scheme are proven by studying a large number of patent similarity cases in the field of mechanical structures."}
