{"abstract":"Synthesizing photo-realistic images based on text descriptions is a challenging image generation problem. Although many recent approaches have significantly advanced the performance of text-to-image generation, to guarantee semantic matchings between the text description and synthesized image remains very challenging. In this paper, we propose a new model, Cross-modal Semantic Matching Generative Adversarial Networks (CSM-GAN), to improve the semantic consistency between text description and synthesized image for a fine-grained text-to-image generation. Two new modules are proposed in CSM-GAN: Text Encoder Module (TEM) and Textual-Visual Semantic Matching Module (TVSMM). TVSMM is aimed at making the distance of the pairs of synthesized image and its corresponding text description closer, in global semantic embedding space, than those of mismatched pairs. This improves the semantic consistency and consequently, the generalizability of CSM-GAN. In TEM, we introduce Text Convolutional Neural Networks (Text_CNNs) to capture and highlight local visual features in textual descriptions. Thorough experiments on two public benchmark datasets demonstrated the superiority of CSM-GAN over other representative state-of-the-art methods."}
