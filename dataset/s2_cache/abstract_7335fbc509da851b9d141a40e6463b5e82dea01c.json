{"abstract":"As NLP models become more integrated with the everyday lives of people, it becomes important to examine the social effect that the usage of these systems has. While these models understand language and have increased accuracy on difficult downstream tasks, there is evidence that these models amplify gender, racial and cultural stereotypes and lead to a vicious cycle in many settings. In this survey, we analyze the origins of biases, the definitions of fairness, and how different subfields of NLP mitigate bias. We finally discuss how future studies can work towards eradicating pernicious biases from NLP algorithms."}
