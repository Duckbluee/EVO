{"abstract":"We study epidemic forecasting on real-world health data by a graph-structured recurrent neural network (GSRNN). We achieve state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy on the benchmark CDC dataset. To improve model efficiency, we sparsify the network weights via transformed-$\\ell_1$ penalty and maintain prediction accuracy at the same level with 70% of the network weights being zero."}
