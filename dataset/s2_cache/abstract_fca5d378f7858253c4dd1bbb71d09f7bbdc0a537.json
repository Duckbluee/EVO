{"abstract":"The in-context learning (ICL) for relational triple extraction (RTE) has achieved promising performance, but still encounters two key challenges: (1) how to design effective prompts and (2) how to select proper demonstrations. Existing methods, however, fail to address these challenges appropriately. On the one hand, they usually recast RTE task to text-to-text prompting formats, which is unnatural and results in a mismatch between the output format at the pre-training time and the inference time for large language models (LLMs). On the other hand, they only utilize surface natural language features and lack consideration of triple semantics in sample selection. These issues are blocking improved performance in ICL for RTE, thus we aim to tackle prompt designing and sample selection challenges simultaneously. To this end, we devise a tabular prompting for RTE (TableIE) which frames RTE task into a table generation task to incorporate explicit structured information into ICL, facilitating conversion of outputs to RTE structures. Then we propose instructive in-context learning (I^2CL) which only selects and annotates a few samples considering internal triple semantics in massive unlabeled samples. Specifically, we first adopt off-the-shelf LLMs to perform schema-agnostic pre-extraction of triples in unlabeled samples using TableIE. Then we propose a novel triple-level similarity metric considering triple semantics between these samples and train a sample retrieval model based on calculated similarities in pre-extracted unlabeled data. We also devise three different sample annotation strategies for various scenarios. Finally, the annotated samples are considered as few-shot demonstrations in ICL for RTE. Experimental results on two RTE benchmarks show that I^2CL with TableIE achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods under various few-shot RTE settings."}
