{"abstract":"Using High-Level Synthesis (HLS), the hardware designers must describe only a high-level behavioral flow of the design. However, it still can take weeks to develop a high-performance architecture mainly because there are many design choices at a higher level to explore. Besides, it takes several minutes to hours to evaluate the design with the HLS tool. To solve this problem, we model the HLS tool with a graph neural network that is trained to be used for a wide range of applications. The experimental results demonstrate that our model can estimate the quality of design in milliseconds with high accuracy, resulting in up to $79 \\times$ speedup (with an average of $48 \\times$) for optimizing the design compared to the previous state-of-the-art work relying on the HLS tool.ACM Reference Format: Atefeh Sohrabizadeh, Yunsheng Bai, Yizhou Sun, and Jason Cong. 2022.
