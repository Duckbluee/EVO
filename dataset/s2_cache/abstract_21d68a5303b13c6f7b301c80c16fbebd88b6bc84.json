{"abstract":"Deep learning based semantic communication (DLSC) systems have shown great potential of making wireless networks significantly more efficient by only transmitting the semantics of the data. However, the open nature of wireless channel and fragileness of neural models cause DLSC systems extremely vulnerable to various attacks. Traditional wireless physical layer key (PLK), which relies on reciprocal channel and randomness characteristics between two legitimate users, holds the promise of securing DLSC. The main challenge lies in generating secret keys in the static environment with ultra-low/zero rate. Different from prior efforts that use relays or reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to manipulate wireless channels, this paper proposes a novel physical layer semantic encryption scheme by exploring the randomness of bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores in the field of machine translation, and additionally presents a novel semantic obfuscation mechanism to provide further physical layer protections. Specifically, 1) we calculate the BLEU scores and corresponding weights of the DLSC system. Then, we generate semantic keys (SKey) by feeding the weighted sum of the scores into a hash function. 2) Equipped with the SKey, our proposed subcarrier obfuscation is able to further secure semantic communications with a dynamic dummy data insertion mechanism. Experiments show the effectiveness of our method, especially in the static wireless environment."}
