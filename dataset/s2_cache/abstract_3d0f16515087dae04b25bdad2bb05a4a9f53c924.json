{"abstract":"Sharing medical datasets between hospitals is challenging because of the privacy-protection problem and the massive cost of transmitting and storing many high-resolution medical images. However, dataset distillation can synthesize a small dataset such that models trained on it achieve comparable performance with the original large dataset, which shows potential for solving the existing medical sharing problems. Hence, this paper proposes a novel dataset distillation-based method for medical dataset sharing. Experimental results on a COVID-19 chest X-ray image dataset show that our method can achieve high detection performance even using scarce anonymized chest X-ray images."}
