{"abstract":"In silico modelling and analysis of small molecules substantially accelerates the process of drug development. Representing and understanding molecules is the fundamental step for various in silico molecular analysis tasks. Traditionally, these molecular analysis tasks have been investigated individually and separately. In this study, we presented X-MOL, which applies large-scale pre-training technology on 1.1 billion molecules for molecular understanding and representation, and then, carefully designed fine-tuning was performed to accommodate diverse downstream molecular analysis tasks, including molecular property prediction, chemical reaction analysis, drug-drug interaction prediction, de novo generation of molecules and molecule optimization. As a result, X-MOL was proven to achieve state-of-the-art results on all these molecular analysis tasks with good model interpretation ability. Collectively, taking advantage of super large-scale pre-training data and super-computing power, our study practically demonstrated the utility of the idea of “mass makes miracles” in molecular representation learning and downstream in silico molecular analysis, indicating the great potential of using large-scale unlabelled data with carefully designed pre-training and fine-tuning strategies to unify existing molecular analysis tasks and substantially enhance the performance of each task."}
