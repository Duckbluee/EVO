{"abstract":"Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to efficient machine learning with privacy protection in distributed environments, such as Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile-edge computing (MEC). The effectiveness of FL relies on a group of participant nodes that contribute their data and computing capacities to the collaborative training of a global model. Therefore, preventing malicious nodes from adversely affecting the model training while incentivizing credible nodes to contribute to the learning process plays a crucial role in enhancing FL security and performance. Seeking to contribute to the literature, we propose a blockchain-empowered secure and incentive FL (BESIFL) paradigm in this article. Specifically, BESIFL leverages blockchain to achieve a fully decentralized FL system, where effective mechanisms for malicious node detections and incentive management are fully integrated in a unified framework. The experimental results show that the proposed BESIFL is effective in improving FL performance through its protection against malicious nodes, incentive management, and selection of credible nodes."}
