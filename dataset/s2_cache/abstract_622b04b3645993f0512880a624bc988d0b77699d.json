{"abstract":"Consider a set of vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, partitioned into two classes: normal vectors and malicious vectors. The number of malicious vectors is bounded but their identities are unknown. The paper provides a way for achieving a resilient convex combination, which is a convex combination of only normal vectors. Compared with existing approaches based on Tverberg points, the proposed method based on the intersection of convex hulls has lower computational complexity. Simulations suggest that the proposed method can be applied to resilience for consensus-based distributed algorithms against Byzantine attacks."}
