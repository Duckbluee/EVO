{"abstract":"Existing learning-based methods for blind image quality assessment (BIQA) are heavily dependent on large amounts of annotated training data, and usually suffer from a severe performance degradation when encountering the domain/distribution shift problem. Thanks to the development of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), some works attempt to transfer the knowledge from a label-sufficient source domain to a label-free target domain under domain shift with UDA. However, it requires the coexistence of source and target data, which might be impractical for source data due to the privacy or storage issues. In this paper, we take the first step towards the source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) in a simple yet efficient manner for BIQA to tackle the domain shift without access to the source data. Specifically, we cast the quality assessment task as a rating distribution prediction problem. Based on the intrinsic properties of BIQA, we present a group of well-designed self-supervised objectives to guide the adaptation of the BN affine parameters towards the target domain. Among them, minimizing the prediction entropy and maximizing the batch prediction diversity aim to encourage more confident results while avoiding the trivial solution. Besides, based on the observation that the IQA rating distribution of single image follows the Gaussian distribution, we apply Gaussian regularization to the predicted rating distribution to make it more consistent with the nature of human scoring. Extensive experimental results under cross-domain scenarios demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method to mitigate the domain shift."}
