{"abstract":"Chronic neck and shoulder pain (CNSP) is a major global public health issue. Traditional treatments like physiotherapy and rehabilitation have drawbacks, including high costs, low precision, and user discomfort. This paper presents an interactive system based on Cognitive Therapy Theory (CBT) for CNSP treatment. The system includes a pain detection module using EMG and IMU to monitor pain and optimize data with Rough Set theory, and a cognitive therapy module that processes this data further for CBT-based interventions, including massage and heating therapy. An experimental plan is outlined to evaluate the system’s effectiveness and performance. The goal is to create an accessible device for CNSP therapy. Additionally, the paper explores the system’s application in a metaverse environment, enhancing treatment immersion and personalization. The metaverse platform simulates treatment environments and responds to real-time patient data, allowing for continuous monitoring and adjustment of treatment plans."}
