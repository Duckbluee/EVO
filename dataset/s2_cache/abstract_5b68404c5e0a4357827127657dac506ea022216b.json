{"abstract":"Computer architecture simulation tools are essential for implementing and evaluating new ideas in the domain and can be useful for understanding the behavior of programs and finding microarchitectural bottlenecks. One particularly important part of almost any processor is the cache hierarchy. While some simulators support simulating a whole processor, including the cache hierarchy, cores, and on-chip interconnect, others may only support simulating the cache hierarchy. This survey provides a detailed discussion on 28 CPU cache simulators, including popular or recent simulators. We compare between all of these simulators in four different ways: major design characteristics, support for specific cache design features, support for specific cache-related metrics, and validation methods and efforts. The strengths and shortcomings of each simulator and major issues that are common to all simulators are highlighted. The information presented in this survey was collected from many different sources, including research papers, documentations, source code bases, and others. This survey is potentially useful for both users and developers of cache simulators. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey on cache simulation tools."}
