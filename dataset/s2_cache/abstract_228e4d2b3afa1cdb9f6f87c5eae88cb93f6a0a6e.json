{"abstract":"This paper presents results of Document Visual Question Answering Challenge organized as part of \"Text and Documents in the Deep Learning Era\" workshop, in CVPR 2020. The challenge introduces a new problem - Visual Question Answering on document images. The challenge comprised two tasks. The first task concerns with asking questions on a single document image. On the other hand, the second task is set as a retrieval task where the question is posed over a collection of images. For the task 1 a new dataset is introduced comprising 50,000 questions-answer(s) pairs defined over 12,767 document images. For task 2 another dataset has been created comprising 20 questions over 14,362 document images which share the same document template."}
