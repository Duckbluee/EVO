{"abstract":"Channel state information (CSI) reporting is important for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless transceivers to achieve high capacity and energy efficiency in frequency division duplex (FDD) mode. CSI reporting for massive MIMO systems could consume large bandwidth and degrade spectrum efficiency. Deep learning (DL)-based CSI reporting integrated with channel characteristics has demonstrated success in improving CSI compression and recovery. To further improve the encoding efficiency of CSI feedback, we develop an efficient DL-based compression framework CQNet to jointly tackle CSI compression, codeword quantization, and recovery under the bandwidth constraint. CQNet is directly compatible with other DL-based CSI feedback works for further enhancement. We propose a more efficient quantization scheme in the radial coordinate by introducing a novel magnitude-adaptive phase quantization framework. Compared with traditional CSI reporting, CQNet demonstrates superior CSI feedback efficiency and better CSI reconstruction accuracy."}
