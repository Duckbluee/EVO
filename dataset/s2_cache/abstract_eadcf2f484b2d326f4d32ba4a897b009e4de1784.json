{"abstract":"Automated unit test generation is a well-known methodology aiming to reduce the developers’ effort of writing tests manually. Prior research focused mainly on statically typed programming languages like Java. In practice, however, dynamically typed languages have received a huge gain in popularity over the last decade. This introduces the need for tools and research on test generation for these languages, too. We introduce Pynguin, an extendable testgeneration framework for Python, which generates regression tests with high code coverage. Pynguin is designed to be easily usable by practitioners; it is also extensible to allow researchers to adapt it for their needs and to enable future research. We provide a demo of Pynguin at https://youtu.be/UiGrG25Vts0; further information, documentation, the tool, and its source code are available at https://www.pynguin.eu."}
