{"abstract":"Semantic navigation is necessary to deploy mobile robots in uncontrolled environments such as homes or hospitals. Many learning-based approaches have been proposed in response to the lack of semantic understanding of the classical pipeline for spatial navigation, which builds a geometric map using depth sensors and plans to reach point goals. Broadly, end-to-end learning approaches reactively map sensor inputs to actions with deep neural networks, whereas modular learning approaches enrich the classical pipeline with learning-based semantic sensing and exploration. However, learned visual navigation policies have predominantly been evaluated in sim, with little known about what works on a robot. We present a large-scale empirical study of semantic visual navigation methods comparing representative methods with classical, modular, and end-to-end learning approaches across six homes with no prior experience, maps, or instrumentation. We found that modular learning works well in the real world, attaining a 90% success rate. In contrast, end-to-end learning does not, dropping from 77% sim to a 23% real-world success rate because of a large image domain gap between sim and reality. For practitioners, we show that modular learning is a reliable approach to navigate to objects: Modularity and abstraction in policy design enable sim-to-real transfer. For researchers, we identify two key issues that prevent today’s simulators from being reliable evaluation benchmarks—a large sim-to-real gap in images and a disconnect between sim and real-world error modes—and propose concrete steps forward.
