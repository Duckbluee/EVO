{"abstract":"Gait recognition is an important biometric technology that identiﬁes a person by us-ing walking posture. Recently, most gait recognition methods either take the human gait as a whole to generate Global Feature Representation (GFR) or equivalently divide the human gait into multiple local regions to establish Local Feature Representation (LFR). However, we observe that LFR or GFR does not adequately represent the human gait because that LFR only focuses on the detailed information of each local region and GFR pays more attention to the global context information. On the other hand, the partition manner of the local regions is ﬁxed, which only focuses on the local information of several speciﬁc regions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel mask-based network, named GaitMask, for gait recognition. GaitMask is built based on the Mask-based Local Augmentation (MLA), which is used to learn more comprehensive feature representations. MLA is a dual-branch structure consisting of a GFR extraction module as the trunk and a mask-based LFR extraction module as the branch. Speciﬁcally, the mask-based LFR extraction consists of a pair of complementary masks, where one mask randomly drops a region of the input feature maps and the other one only preserves this region. The complementary mask can be used to generate more comprehensive LFR and enhances the robustness of feature representations of the trunk. Experiments on two popular datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Speciﬁcally, the proposed method signiﬁcantly increases the performance in complex environments."}
