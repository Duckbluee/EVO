{"abstract":"Given a set of node-labeled directed weighted graphs, how to find the most anomalous ones? How can we summarize the normal behavior in the database without losing information? We propose GAWD, for detecting anomalous graphs in directed weighted graph databases. The idea is to (1) iteratively identify the \"best\" substructure (i.e., subgraph or motif) that yields the largest compression when each of its occurrences is replaced by a super-node, and (2) score each graph by how much it compresses over iterations --- the more the compression, the lower the anomaly score. Different from existing work [1] on which we build, GAWD exhibits (i) a lossless graph encoding scheme, (ii) ability to handle numeric edge weights, (iii) interpretability by common patterns, and (iv) scalability with running time linear in input size. Experiments on four datasets injected with anomalies show that GAWD achieves significantly better results than state-of-the-art baselines."}
