{"abstract":"Data augmentation is an important procedure in deep learning. GAN-based data augmentation can be utilized in many domains. For instance, in the credit card fraud domain, the imbalanced dataset problem is a major one as the number of credit card fraud cases is in the minority compared to legal payments. On the other hand, generative techniques are considered effective ways to rebalance the imbalanced class issue, as these techniques balance both minority and majority classes before the training. In a more recent period, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are considered one of the most popular data generative techniques as they are used in big data settings. This research aims to present a survey on data augmentation using various GAN variants in the credit card fraud detection domain. In this survey, we offer a comprehensive summary of several peer-reviewed research papers on GAN synthetic generation techniques for fraud detection in the financial sector. In addition, this survey includes various solutions proposed by different researchers to balance imbalanced classes. In the end, this work concludes by pointing out the limitations of the most recent research articles and future research issues, and proposes solutions to address these problems."}
