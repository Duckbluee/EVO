{"abstract":"Accurately predicting object depth is a key challenge in monocular 3D detection task. The perspective projection principle used by most state-of-the-art approaches demands a complex balance between the ratio-form depth estimation and 2D-3D geometric regularizations, and thus can lead to sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel synergistic scheme that can achieve better trade-off among these competing objectives. Our main proposal is a progressive depth regularization (PDR) architecture that splits the overall training process into three sequential depth estimation steps to gradually remove the unwanted deviations induced by the over-regularization. Specifically, our model first learns the coarse depth with the conventional perspective projection and combines the coarse-to-fine generation to reduce the search space of 2D projection height prediction. We then deactivate individual supervision on 2D projection height prediction and introduces a new auxiliary 3D physical height prediction to relax the 2D and 3D regularizations, respectively. Consequently, our PDR leads to more precise depth estimation by mitigating the inherent ambiguities in the geometric priors of perspective projection through progressive regularization relaxation. Extensive experiments on both KITTI and Rope3D benchmark show that our PDR delivers strong performance gains as compared to the previous methods."}
