{"abstract":"Recent advances in information technologies have facilitated applications to generate, collect or process large amounts of sensitive personal data. Emerging cloud storage services provide a better paradigm to support the needs of such applications. Such cloud based solutions introduce additional security and privacy challenges when dealing with outsourced data including that of supporting fine-grained access control over such data stored in the cloud. In this paper, we propose an integrated, privacy-preserving user-centric attribute based access control framework to ensure the security and privacy of users’ data outsourced and stored by a cloud service provider (CSP). The core component of the proposed framework is a novel privacy-preserving, revocable ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (PR-CP-ABE) scheme. To support advanced access control features like write access on encrypted data and privacy-preserving access policy updates, we propose extended Path-ORAM access protocol that can also prevent privacy disclosure of access patterns. We also propose an integrated secure deduplication approach to improve the storage efficiency of CSPs while protecting data privacy. Finally, we evaluate the proposed framework and compare it with other existing solutions with regards to the security and performance issues."}
