{"abstract":"Structural re-parameterization is a general training scheme for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which achieves performance improvement without increasing inference cost. As Vision Transformers (ViTs) are gradually surpassing CNNs in various visual tasks, one may question: if a training scheme specifically for ViTs exists that can also achieve performance improvement without increasing inference cost? Recently, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has attracted increasing attention, as it can efficiently scale up the capacity of Transformers at a fixed cost through sparsely activated experts. Considering that MoE can also be viewed as a multi-branch structure, can we utilize MoE to implement a ViT training scheme similar to structural re-parameterization? In this paper, we affirmatively answer these questions, with a new general training strategy for ViTs. Specifically, we decouple the training and inference phases of ViTs. During training, we replace some Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) of the ViT with specially designed, more efficient MoEs that assign tokens to experts by random uniform partition, and perform Experts Weights Averaging (EWA) on these MoEs at the end of each iteration. After training, we convert each MoE into an FFN by averaging the experts, transforming the model back into original ViT for inference. We further provide a theoretical analysis to show why and how it works. Comprehensive experiments across various 2D and 3D visual tasks, ViT architectures, and datasets validate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed training scheme. Besides, our training scheme can also be applied to improve performance when fine-tuning ViTs. Lastly, but equally important, the proposed EWA technique can significantly improve the effectiveness of naive MoE in various 2D visual small datasets and 3D visual tasks."}
