{"abstract":"In this paper we present a novel approach to abstractive summarization of patient hospitalisation histories. We applied an encoder-decoder framework with Longformer neural network as an encoder and BERT as a decoder. Our experiments show improved quality on some summarization tasks compared with pointer-generator networks. We also conducted a study with experienced physicians evaluating the results of our model in comparison with PGN baseline and human-generated abstracts, which showed the effectiveness of our model."}
