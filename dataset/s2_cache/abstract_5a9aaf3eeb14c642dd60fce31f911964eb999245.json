{"abstract":"In this article, a robust distributed fault detection and isolation (FDI) scheme for second-order multiagent systems (MASs) with exogenous disturbances based on partial agents’ absolute state will be proposed. We design a robust control law with disturbance rejection term for each agent, then, an augmented MAS closed-loop system without disturbance term is formed. We construct a bank of observers for FDI in some selected agents for the augmented MAS closed-loop system based on the idea of an unknown input observer (UIO), where the observers for FDI of the entire MAS are updated by the selected agents’ absolute states and relative states between themselves and their neighbors, which avoids utilizing all agents’ absolute states. We run observers for FDI in the selected agents to generate residuals to detect the faulty agent between themselves and their neighbors. Meanwhile, the existence proof of observers for FDI is also presented. It is worth noting that the remaining healthy agents will reach consensus again under the original robust control law if the communication topology is still connected. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is illustrated by a multivehicle example."}
