{"abstract":"This paper proposes a distributed control scheme for multi-agent systems to achieve resilient ﬂocking behaviour via event-based communication. The control scheme can pro-vide the required connectivity conditions to form a ﬂock in the presence of cyberattacks in the network. This method is presented in a fully distributed manner to avoid the use of global data. The developed event-triggered update rules can mitigate the inﬂuence of the non-cooperative agents with the weighted mean subsequence-reduced algorithm and reduce unnecessary communication among them. It is proved that under the proposed method, convergence is guaranteed and there is no Zeno behaviour exhibited inherently. To relax the requirement of continuous monitoring of self-state, a self-triggered mechanism is proposed further. Simulation results are given to illustrate the theoretical analysis and show the advantages of the event- and self-triggered controllers."}
