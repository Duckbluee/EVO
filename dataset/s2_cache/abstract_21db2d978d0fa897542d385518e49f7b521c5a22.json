{"abstract":"Since the facts in the knowledge graph (KG) cannot be updated automatically over time, some facts have temporal conflicts. To discover and eliminate the temporal conflicts in the KG, this paper proposes a novel temporal conflict resolution method based on temporal KG embedding (named TeCre). Firstly, the predicate relation and timestamp information of time series are incorporated into the entity–relation embedding representation by leveraging the temporal KG embedding (KGE) method. Then, taking into account the chronological sequence of the evolution of the entity–relation representation over time, TeCre constrains the temporal relation in the KG according to the principles of time disjoint, time precedence, and time mutually exclusive constraints. Besides that, TeCre further considers the sequence vectorization of predicate relation to discover the temporal conflict facts in the KG. Finally, to eliminate the temporal conflict facts, TeCre deletes the tail entities of the temporal conflict facts, and employs the link prediction method to complete the missing tail entities according to the output of the score function based on the entity–relation embedding. Experimental results on four public datasets show that TeCre is significantly better than the state-of-the-art temporal KG conflict resolution model. The mean reciprocal ranking (MRR) and Hits@10 of TeCre are at least 5.46% and 3.2% higher than the baseline methods, respectively."}
