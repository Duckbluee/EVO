{"abstract":"This letter presents a novel and unified distributed control framework that ensures resilient leader-follower consensus in the presence of unknown but bounded attacks on both the communication network and actuators while simultaneously preserving the privacy of an agent’s physical state from eavesdroppers. To this end, a virtual state and time-varying signals are introduced to each agent, which function as masks to the physical state and are designed to ensure resilient leader-follower consensus. The proposed control strategy does not require high network connectivity and imposes no restrictions on the number of attacks. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the results."}
