{"abstract":"Diffusion model is the most advanced method in image generation and has been successfully applied to MRI reconstruction. However, the existing methods do not consider the characteristics of multi-coil acquisition of MRI data. Therefore, we give a new diffusion model, called SPIRiT-Diffusion, based on the SPIRiT iterative reconstruction algorithm. Specifically, SPIRiT-Diffusion characterizes the prior distribution of coil-by-coil images by score matching and characterizes the k-space redundant prior between coils based on self-consistency. With sufficient prior constraint utilized, we achieve superior reconstruction results on the joint Intracranial and Carotid Vessel Wall imaging dataset."}
