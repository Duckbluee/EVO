{"abstract":"COVID-19 is a life threatening disease which has a enormous global impact. As the cause of the disease is a novel coronavirus whose gene information is unknown, drugs and vaccines are yet to be found. For the present situation, disease spread analysis and prediction with the help of mathematical and data driven model will be of great help to initiate prevention and control action, namely lockdown and qurantine. There are various mathematical and machine-learning models proposed for analyzing the spread and prediction. Each model has its own limitations and advantages for a particluar scenario. This article reviews the state-of-the art mathematical models for COVID-19, including compartment models, statistical models and machine learning models to provide more insight, so that an appropriate model can be well adopted for the disease spread analysis. Furthermore, accurate diagnose of COVID-19 is another essential process to identify the infected person and control further spreading. As the spreading is fast, there is a need for quick auotomated diagnosis mechanism to handle large population. Deep-learning and machine-learning based diagnostic mechanism will be more appropriate for this purpose. In this aspect, a comprehensive review on the deep learning models for the diagnosis of the disease is also provided in this article."}
