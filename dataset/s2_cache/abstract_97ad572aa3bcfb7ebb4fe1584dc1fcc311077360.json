{"abstract":"You only look once (YOLO) is being used as the most popular object detection software in many intelligent video applications due to its ease of use and high object detection precision. In addition, in recent years, various intelligent vision systems based on high-performance embedded systems are being developed. Nevertheless, the YOLO still requires high-end hardware for successful real-time object detection. In this paper, we first discuss real-time object detection service of the YOLO on AI embedded systems with resource constraints. In particular, we point out the problems related to real-time processing in YOLO object detection associated with network cameras, and then propose a novel YOLO architecture with adaptive frame control (AFC) that can efficiently cope with these problems. Through various experiments, we show that the proposed AFC can maintain the high precision and convenience of YOLO, and provide real-time object detection service by minimizing total service delay, which remains a limitation of the pure YOLO."}
