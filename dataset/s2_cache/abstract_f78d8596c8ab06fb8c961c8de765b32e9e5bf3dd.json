{"abstract":"One of the challenges in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is that there are limited labeled samples to train a classifier for very high-dimensional data. In practical applications, we often encounter an HSI domain (called target domain) with very few labeled data, while another HSI domain (called source domain) may have enough labeled data. Classes between the two domains may not be the same. This article attempts to use source class data to help classify the target classes, including the same and new unseen classes. To address this classification paradigm, a meta-learning paradigm for few-shot learning (FSL) is usually adopted. However, existing FSL methods do not account for domain shift between source and target domain. To solve the FSL problem under domain shift, a novel deep cross-domain few-shot learning (DCFSL) method is proposed. For the first time, DCFSL tackles FSL and domain adaptation issues in a unified framework. Specifically, a conditional adversarial domain adaptation strategy is utilized to overcome domain shift, which can achieve domain distribution alignment. In addition, FSL is executed in source and target classes at the same time, which can not only discover transferable knowledge in the source classes but also learn a discriminative embedding model to the target classes. Experiments conducted on four public HSI data sets demonstrate that DCFSL outperforms the existing FSL methods and deep learning methods for HSI classification.
