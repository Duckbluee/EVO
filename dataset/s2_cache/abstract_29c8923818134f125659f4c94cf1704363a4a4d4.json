{"abstract":"Graph Neural Network (GNN) has emerged as a predominant tool for graph data analysis. Despite their proliferation, the low-quality labels of many real-world graphs will undermine their performance dramatically. Existing studies on learning neural networks with noisy labels mainly focus on independent data and thus cannot fully exploit the structural information of graph data. Currently, there are few studies of robustness to noisy labels for graph-structured data even if this problem is commonly seen in real-world settings. To remedy this deficiency, we propose GNN Cleaner which utilizes structural information of graph data to combat noisy labels. More specifically, a pseudo label is computed from the neighboring labels for each node in the training set via a modified version of label propagation. Additionally, a novel method is developed to learn to correct the labels adaptively and dynamically. Extensive experiments show that GNN Cleaner can train GNNs robustly and correct both the synthetic and real-world noisy labels even if the noise is severe. Moreover, GNN Cleaner is model-agnostic and can be combined with various GNNs to improve their robustness against label noise."}
