{"abstract":"In drug-discovery-related tasks such as virtual screening, machine learning is emerging as a promising way to predict molecular properties. Conventionally, molecular fingerprints (numerical representations of molecules) are calculated through rule-based algorithms that map molecules to a sparse discrete space. However, these algorithms perform poorly for shallow prediction models or small datasets. To address this issue, we present SMILES Transformer. Inspired by Transformer and pre-trained language models from natural language processing, SMILES Transformer learns molecular fingerprints through unsupervised pre-training of the sequence-to-sequence language model using a huge corpus of SMILES, a text representation system for molecules. We performed benchmarks on 10 datasets against existing fingerprints and graph-based methods and demonstrated the superiority of the proposed algorithms in small-data settings where pre-training facilitated good generalization. Moreover, we define a novel metric to concurrently measure model accuracy and data efficiency."}
