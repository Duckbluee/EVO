{"abstract":"Reconstructing visual stimuli from human brain activities is a challenging task in the field of computer vision. Although deep learning methods have been introduced to address this problem recently, it remains a difficult task due to the limited availability of labeled training data and the complexity of extracting semantic features from fMRI signals. In this study, we propose a novel approach for visual decoding method using brain context autoencoder (BCAE) and latent diffusion model with attention conditioning (LDMAC). In the first stage, we introduce the BCAE to learn effective representations of fMRI in a self-supervised manner. In the second stage, we employ the LDMAC generator, which is trained with attention conditioning mechanism, to generate semantically meaningful and realistic images. We evaluate the proposed method on two datasets, GOD and BOLD5000, and demonstrate competitive performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our results indicate that our proposed approach is a promising solution to the challenging problem of visual decoding from fMRI signals."}
