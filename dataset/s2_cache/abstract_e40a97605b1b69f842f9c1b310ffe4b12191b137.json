{"abstract":"Quantum communication networks (QCNs) utilize quantum mechanics for secure information transmission, but the reliance on fragile and expensive photonic quantum resources renders QCN resource optimization challenging. Unlike prior QCN works that relied on blindly compressing direct quantum embeddings of classical data, this letter proposes a novel quantum semantic communications (QSC) framework exploiting advancements in quantum machine learning and quantum semantic representations to extracts and embed only the relevant information from classical data into minimal high-dimensional quantum states that are accurately communicated over quantum channels with quantum communication and semantic fidelity measures. Simulation results indicate that, compared to semantic-agnostic QCN schemes, the proposed framework achieves approximately 50-75% reduction in quantum communication resources needed, while achieving a higher quantum semantic fidelity."}
