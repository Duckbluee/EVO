{"abstract":"Graph neural network (GNN) is a distributional model that represents graph dependencies through message exchange between graph nodes. It is possible to think of a recommendation system as an algorithm for predicting links between nodes in a graph, in which there are complex networks consisting of user-item, user-user and other relationships, and GNN, based on the advantage of feature extraction and representation of data from the graph domain, can better explore its intrinsic associations and realize more accurate recommendation services. In this paper, we review the proposed graph neural network models and their applications in recommendation systems, discuss the major progress of related research, and propose issues for further research."}
