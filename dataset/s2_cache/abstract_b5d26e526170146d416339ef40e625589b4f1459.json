{"abstract":". Let { f i } Ni =1 be a set of equi-contractive similitudes on R 1 satisfying the ﬁnite-type condition. We study the asymptotic quantization error for the self-similar measures µ associated with { f i } Ni =1 and a positive probability vector. With a veriﬁable assumption, we prove that the upper and lower quantization coeﬃcient for µ are both bounded away from zero and inﬁnity. This can be regarded as an extension of Graf and Luschgy’s result on self-similar measures with the open set condition. Our result is applicable to a signiﬁcant class of self-similar measures with overlaps, including Erd¨os measure, the 3-fold convolution of the classical Cantor measure and the self-similar measures on some λ -Cantor sets."}
