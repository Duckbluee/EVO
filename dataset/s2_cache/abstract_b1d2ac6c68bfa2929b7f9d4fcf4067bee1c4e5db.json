{"abstract":"Parameter-efﬁcient transfer learning (PETL) methods show promise in adapting a pre-trained model to various downstream tasks while training only a few parameters. In the computer vision (CV) domain, numerous PETL algorithms have been proposed, but their direct employment or comparison remains inconvenient. To address this challenge, we construct a Uniﬁed Visual PETL Benchmark (V-PETL Bench) for the CV domain by selecting 30 diverse, challenging"}
