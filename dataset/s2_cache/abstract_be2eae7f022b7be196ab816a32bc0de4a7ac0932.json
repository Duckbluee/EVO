{"abstract":"Deep learning raises interests of research community as their overwhelming successes in information processing such specific tasks as video/speech recognition. In this paper, we provide a state-of-the-art analysis of deep learning with its applications in an important direction: natural language processing. We attempt to provide a clear and critical summarization for researchers and participators who are interested in incorporating the deep learning techniques in their specific domains."}
