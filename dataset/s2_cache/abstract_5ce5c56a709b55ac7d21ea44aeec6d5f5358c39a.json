{"abstract":"European Studies is focused on the analysis of national and transnational developments in the European continent as a whole and is both multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary in approach (see below). Because the definition of the subject area is shaped by contemporary phenomena, the curriculum is constantly evolving. For example, the terrorist attacks in Madrid and London and the responses to them, raise specific questions about external policy, migration, and civil liberties; and the defeat of the Constitutional treaty in the French and Dutch referenda give rise to renewed discussions about the nature of the EU and its popular legitimacy on its current basis. While there is variation in the disciplinary composition of the degrees, the typical subjects include law, economics, politics and international relations, history, sociology, business administration. There are also differences in the structure, content and approach to teaching / learning, both according to national traditions and the Faculty/Department in which the degrees developed (for example, Law, Economics or Politics). Finally, there are currently some differences of emphasis between the programmes in the new member states (and applicant countries) on the one hand and longer term members on the other, since there is a more urgent need for training on European integration in the former. However, there are also very considerable similarities in the objectives of the degrees and the competences they seek to foster. It is also important to note that European Studies is a relatively young subject area and new developments may be expected as a result of experience over time and mutual learning from academic staff in the different countries. Yet the European Studies subject group also believe that the diversity of approaches is beneficial and that it would be a great mistake to attempt to impose any uniformity of provision."}
