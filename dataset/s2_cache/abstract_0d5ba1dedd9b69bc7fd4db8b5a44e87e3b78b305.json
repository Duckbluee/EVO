{"abstract":"One-shot talking head generation has received growing attention in recent years, with various creative and practical applications. An ideal natural and vivid generated talking head video should contain natural head pose changes. However, it is challenging to map head pose sequences from driving audio since there exists a natural gap between audio-visual modalities. In this work, we propose a Flow-guided One-shot model that achieves NaTural head motions(FONT) over generated talking heads. Specifically, we design a probabilistic CVAE-based model to predict head pose sequences from driving audio and source face. Then we develop a keypoint predictor that produces unsupervised keypoints describing the facial structure information from the source face, driving audio and pose sequences. Finally, a flow- guided occlusion-aware generator is employed to produce photo-realistic talking head videos from the estimated keypoints and source face. Extensive experimental results prove that FONT generates talking heads with natural head poses and synchronized mouth shapes, outperforming other compared methods."}
