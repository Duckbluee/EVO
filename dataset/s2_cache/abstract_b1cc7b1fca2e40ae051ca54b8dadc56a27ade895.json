{"abstract":"Visually-aware recommender systems have found widespread applications in domains where visual elements significantly contribute to the inference of users’ potential preferences. While the incorporation of visual information holds the promise of enhancing recommendation accuracy and alleviating the cold-start problem, it is essential to point out that the inclusion of item images may introduce substantial security challenges. Some existing works have shown that the item provider can manipulate item exposure rates to its advantage by constructing adversarial images. However, these works cannot reveal the real vulnerability of visually-aware recommender systems because (1) the generated adversarial images are markedly distorted, rendering them easily detected by human observers; and (2) the effectiveness of these attacks is inconsistent and even ineffective in some scenarios or datasets. To shed light on the real vulnerabilities of visually-aware recommender systems when confronted with adversarial images, this article introduces a novel attack method, Item Promotion by Diffusion Generated Image (IPDGI). Specifically, IPDGI employs a guided diffusion model to generate adversarial samples designed to promote the exposure rates of target items (e.g., long-tail items). Taking advantage of accurately modeling benign images’ distribution by diffusion models, the generated adversarial images have high fidelity with original images, ensuring the stealth of our IPDGI. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we conduct extensive experiments on two commonly used e-commerce recommendation datasets (Amazon Beauty and Amazon Baby) with several typical visually-aware recommender systems. The experimental results show that our attack method significantly improves both the performance of promoting the long-tailed (i.e., unpopular) items and the quality of generated adversarial images."}
