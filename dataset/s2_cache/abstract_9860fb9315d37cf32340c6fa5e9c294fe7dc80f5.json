{"abstract":"Compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) into task-specific Small Language Models (SLMs) encounters two significant challenges: safeguarding domain-specific knowledge privacy and managing limited resources. To tackle these challenges, we propose PPC-GPT, a novel unified framework that systematically addresses both privacy preservation and model compression in federated settings. PPC-GPT works on a server-client federated architecture, where the client sends differentially private (DP) perturbed task-specific data to the server's LLM. The LLM then generates synthetic data along with their corresponding rationales. This synthetic data is subsequently used for both LLM pruning and retraining processes. Our framework's key innovation lies in its holistic integration of privacy-preserving mechanisms, synthetic data generation, and task-specific compression techniques, creating unique benefits through component interaction. Our experiments across diverse text generation tasks demonstrate that PPC-GPT successfully achieves dual objectives: maintaining competitive performance comparable to full-sized LLMs while ensuring robust privacy protection through its federated architecture. Our code has been contributed to the FATE open-source project and is now publicly accessible at \\textit{https://github.com/FederatedAI/FATE-LLM/tree/main/python/fate_llm/algo/ppc-gpt}"}
