{"abstract":"In this article, we investigate time-varying output formation tracking problems for heterogeneous multiagent systems in an adversarial environment, where both leaders and followers are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Despite the presence of adversarial agents, the normal followers not suffering from cyber-attacks seek to achieve a desired formation configuration and track a safe trajectory generated by normal leaders' outputs simultaneously. To this end, a resilient time-varying output formation (RTVOF) tracking scheme is presented in this work. First, to counteract the effect of adversarial agents, a safety strategy is proposed for general linear heterogeneous systems, which is a synthesis of the mean-subsequence-reduced family algorithms and an attack detection procedure. Second, using the neighboring interaction, a resilient distributed observer and a local formation controller are designed for each normal follower to estimate the state and track the output of the safe formation reference. Then, it is proved that the heterogeneous multiagent system with multiple dynamic leaders and time-varying topologies can accomplish the RTVOF tracking if specific graph-theoretic properties and formation feasibility conditions are satisfied. Finally, simulation examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of obtained results."}
