{"abstract":"Temporal video grounding (TVG) is a critical task in video content understanding, requiring precise alignment between video content and natural language instructions. Despite significant advancements, existing methods face challenges in managing confidence bias towards salient objects and capturing long-term dependencies in video sequences. To address these issues, we introduce SpikeMba: a multi-modal spiking saliency mamba for temporal video grounding. Our approach integrates Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with state space models (SSMs) to leverage their unique advantages in handling different aspects of the task. Specifically, we use SNNs to develop a spiking saliency detector that generates the proposal set. The detector emits spike signals when the input signal exceeds a predefined threshold, resulting in a dynamic and binary saliency proposal set. To enhance the model's capability to retain and infer contextual information, we introduce relevant slots which learnable tensors that encode prior knowledge. These slots work with the contextual moment reasoner to maintain a balance between preserving contextual information and exploring semantic relevance dynamically. The SSMs facilitate selective information propagation, addressing the challenge of long-term dependency in video content. By combining SNNs for proposal generation and SSMs for effective contextual reasoning, SpikeMba addresses confidence bias and long-term dependencies, thereby significantly enhancing fine-grained multimodal relationship capture. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SpikeMba, which consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across mainstream benchmarks."}
