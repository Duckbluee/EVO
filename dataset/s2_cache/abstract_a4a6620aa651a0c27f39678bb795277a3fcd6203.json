{"abstract":"Scene text removal (STR) is the image transformation task to remove text regions in scene images. The conventional STR methods remove all scene text. This means that the existing methods cannot select text to be removed. In this paper, we propose a novel task setting named selective scene text removal (SSTR) that removes only target words specified by the user. Although SSTR is a more complex task than STR, the proposed multi-module structure enables efficient training for SSTR. Experimental results show that the proposed method can remove target words as expected."}
