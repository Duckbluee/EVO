{"abstract":"Machine Unlearning (MU) has recently gained considerable attention due to its potential to achieve Safe AI by removing the influence of specific data from trained Machine Learning (ML) models. This process, known as knowledge removal, addresses AI governance concerns of training data such as quality, sensitivity, copyright restrictions, obsolescence, and compliance with privacy regulations. Efforts have been made to design efficient unlearning approaches, with MU services being examined for integration with existing machine learning as a service (MLaaS), allowing users to submit requests to remove specific data from the training corpus. However, recent research highlights vulnerabilities in machine unlearning systems that can lead to significant security and privacy concerns. Moreover, extensive research indicates that unlearning methods and prevalent attacks fulfill diverse roles within MU systems. This underscores the intricate relationship and complex interplay among these mechanisms in maintaining system functionality and safety. This survey aims to fill the gap between the extensive number of studies on threats, attacks, and defenses in machine unlearning and the absence of a comprehensive review that categorizes their taxonomy, methods, and solutions, thus offering valuable insights for future research directions and practical implementations."}
