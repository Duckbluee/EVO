{"abstract":"Anomaly detection systems are a promising tool to identify compromised user credentials and malicious insiders in enterprise networks. Most existing approaches for modelling user behaviour rely on either independent observations for each user or on pre-defined user peer groups. A method is proposed based on recommender system algorithms to learn overlapping user peer groups and to use this learned structure to detect anomalous activity. Results analysing the authentication and process-running activities of thousands of users show that the proposed method can detect compromised user accounts during a red team exercise."}
