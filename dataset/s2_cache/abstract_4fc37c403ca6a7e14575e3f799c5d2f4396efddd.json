{"abstract":"In order to advance the field of procedural content generation, and transfer knowledge from academic research to everyday use, we need to develop tools that make generative systems easier to understand and control. In this article, we introduce Danesh, a plugin to the unity game development environment, which helps provide a suite of tools that provide automation or analysis of different aspects of procedural generators. We describe here the features of Danesh, including automatic analysis of generated content, the visualization of generative spaces, automatic parameter discovery, and interface smoothing. We also provide reflections on our development of the tool so far."}
