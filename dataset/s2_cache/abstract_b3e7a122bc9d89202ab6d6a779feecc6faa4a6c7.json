{"abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) have opened up enormous opportunities while simultaneously posing ethical dilemmas. One of the major concerns is their ability to create text that closely mimics human writing, which can lead to potential misuse, such as academic misconduct, disinformation, and fraud. To address this problem, we present AuthentiGPT, an efficient classifier that distinguishes between machine-generated and human-written texts. Under the assumption that human-written text resides outside the distribution of machine-generated text, AuthentiGPT leverages a black-box LLM to denoise input text with artificially added noise, and then semantically compares the denoised text with the original to determine if the content is machine-generated. With only one trainable parameter, AuthentiGPT eliminates the need for a large training dataset, watermarking the LLM's output, or computing the log-likelihood. Importantly, the detection capability of AuthentiGPT can be easily adapted to any generative language model. With a 0.918 AUROC score on a domain-specific dataset, AuthentiGPT demonstrates its effectiveness over other commercial algorithms, highlighting its potential for detecting machine-generated text in academic settings."}
