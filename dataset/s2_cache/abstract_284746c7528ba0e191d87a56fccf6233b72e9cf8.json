{"abstract":"Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized learning method that deviated from the conventional centralized learning. The FL progresses learning locally on each device and gradually improves the learning model through interaction with the central server. However, it can cause network overload because of limited communication bandwidth and the participation of a huge number of users. One of the ways to minimize the network load is for the model to converge rapidly and stably with target learning accuracy. In this paper, we propose blockchain based federated learning scenario. Blockchain can efficiently induce users to participate in learning and can separate each participating user as a ‘node’. In addition, it can be pursued the integrity, stability, and so on. We consider two types of weights to choose the subset of clients for updating the global model. First, we consider the weight based on local learning accuracy of each client. Second, we consider the weight based on participation frequency of each client. We choose two key performance indicators, learning speed and standard deviation, to compare the performance of our proposed scheme with existing schemes. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme achieves higher stability along with fast convergence time for targeted accuracy compared to others."}
