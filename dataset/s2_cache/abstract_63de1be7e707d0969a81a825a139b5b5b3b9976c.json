{"abstract":"This paper aims to investigate and achieve seller-side fairness within online marketplaces, where many sellers and their items are not sufficiently exposed to customers in an e-commerce platform. This phenomenon raises concerns regarding the potential loss of revenue associated with less exposed items as well as less marketplace diversity. We introduce the notion of seller-side outcome fairness and build an optimization model to balance collected recommendation rewards and the fairness metric. We then propose a gradient-based data-driven algorithm based on the duality and bandit theory. Our numerical experiments on real e-commerce data sets show that our algorithm can lift seller fairness measures while not hurting metrics like collected Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and total purchases."}
