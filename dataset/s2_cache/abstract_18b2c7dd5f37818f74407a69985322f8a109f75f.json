{"abstract":"Recent graph neural network (GNN) based methods for few-shot learning (FSL) represent the samples of interest as a fully-connected graph and conduct reasoning on the nodes flatly, which ignores the hierarchical correlations among nodes. However, real-world categories may have hierarchical structures, and for FSL, it is important to extract the distinguishing features of the categories from individual samples. To explore this, we propose a novel hierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) for FSL, which consists of three parts, i.e., bottom-up reasoning, top-down reasoning, and skip connections, to enable the efficient learning of multi-level relationships. For the bottom-up reasoning, we design intra-class k-nearest neighbor pooling (intra-class knnPool) and inter-class knnPool layers, to conduct hierarchical learning for both the intra- and inter-class nodes. For the top-down reasoning, we propose to utilize graph unpooling (gUnpool) layers to restore the down-sampled graph into its original size. Skip connections are proposed to fuse multi-level features for the final node classification. The parameters of HGNN are learned by episodic training with the signal of node losses, which aims to train a well-generalizable model for recognizing unseen classes with few labeled data. Experimental results on benchmark datasets have demonstrated that HGNN outperforms other state-of-the-art GNN based methods significantly, for both transductive and non-transductive FSL tasks.
