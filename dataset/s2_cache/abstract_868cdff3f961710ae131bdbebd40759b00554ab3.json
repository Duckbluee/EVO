{"abstract":"With the implementation of privacy protection laws such as GDPR, it is increasingly difficult for organizations to legally collect user data. However, a typical recommendation algorithm based on machine learning requires user data to learn user preferences. In order to protect user privacy, a lot of recent works turn to develop federated learning-based recommendation algorithms. However, some of these works can only protect the users’ rating values, some can only protect the users’ rating behavior (i.e., the engaged items), and only a few works can protect the both types of privacy at the same time. Moreover, most of them can only be applied to a specific algorithm or a class of similar algorithms. In this paper, we propose a generic cross-user federated recommendation framework called FR-FMSS. Our FR-FMSS can not only protect the two types of user privacy, but can also be applied to most recommendation algorithms for rating prediction, item ranking, and sequential recommendation. Specifically, we use fake marks and secret sharing to modify the data uploaded by the clients to the server, which protects user privacy without loss of model accuracy. We take three representative recommendation algorithms, i.e., MF-MPC, eALS, and Fossil, as examples to show how to apply our FR-FMSS to a specific algorithm."}
