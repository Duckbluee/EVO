This article provides a comprehensive survey of generative models for 3D volumes, focusing on the brain and heart. A new and elaborate taxonomy of unconditional and conditional generative models is proposed to cover diverse medical tasks for the brain and heart: unconditional synthesis, classification, conditional synthesis, segmentation, denoising, detection, and registration. We provide relevant background, examine each task, and also suggest potential future directions. A list of the latest publications will be updated on GitHub to keep up with the rapid influx of papers at https://github.com/csyanbin/3D-Medical-Generative-Survey."}
