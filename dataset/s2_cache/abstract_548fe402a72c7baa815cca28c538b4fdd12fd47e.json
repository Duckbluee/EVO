{"abstract":"Federated learning (FL) has increasingly been deployed, in its vertical form, among organizations to facilitate secure collaborative training. In vertical FL (VFL), participants hold disjoint features of the same set of sample instances. The one with labels - the active party, initiates training and interacts with other participants - the passive parties. It remains largely unknown whether and how an active party can extract private feature data owned by passive parties, especially when training deep neural network (DNN) models. This work examines the feature security problem of DNN training in VFL. We consider a DNN model partitioned between active and passive parties, where the passive party holds a subset of the input layer with some features of binary values. Though proved to be NP-hard. we demonstrate that, unless the feature dimension is exceedingly large, it remains feasible, both theoretically and practically, to launch a reconstruction attack with an efficient search-based algorithm that prevails over current feature protection. We propose a novel feature protection scheme by perturbing intermediate results and fabricated input features, which effectively misleads reconstruction attacks towards pre-specified random values. The evaluation shows it sustains feature reconstruction attack in various VFL applications with negligible impact on model performance."}
