{"abstract":"Recent advances in text-guided video editing have showcased promising results in appearance editing (e.g., stylization). However, video motion editing in the temporal dimension (e.g., from eating to waving), which distinguishes video editing from image editing, is underexplored. In this work, we present UniEdit, a tuning-free framework that supports both video motion and appearance editing by harnessing the power of a pre-trained text-to-video generator within an inversion-then-generation framework. To realize motion editing while preserving source video content, based on the insights that temporal and spatial self-attention layers encode inter-frame and intra-frame dependency, we introduce auxiliary motion-reference and reconstruction branches to produce text-guided motion and source features respectively. The obtained features are then injected into the main editing path via temporal and spatial self-attention layers. We also validate the effectiveness and flexibility of UniEdit by deploying it on three T2V generative models with different architectures. Experiments demonstrate that UniEdit covers video motion editing and various appearance editing scenarios, and surpasses the state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publicly available."}
