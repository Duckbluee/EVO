{"abstract":"Electroencephalography (EEG) has been a staple method for identifying certain health conditions in patients since its discovery. Due to the many different types of classifiers available to use, the analysis methods are also equally numerous. In this review, we will be examining specifically machine learning methods that have been developed for EEG analysis with bioengineering applications. We reviewed literature from 1988 to 2018 to capture previous and current classification methods for EEG in multiple applications. From this information, we are able to determine the overall effectiveness of each machine learning method as well as the key characteristics. We have found that all the primary methods used in machine learning have been applied in some form in EEG classification. This ranges from Naive-Bayes to Decision Tree/Random Forest, to Support Vector Machine (SVM). Supervised learning methods are on average of higher accuracy than their unsupervised counterparts. This includes SVM and KNN. While each of the methods individually is limited in their accuracy in their respective applications, there is hope that the combination of methods when implemented properly has a higher overall classification accuracy. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of Machine Learning applications used in EEG analysis. It also gives an overview of each of the methods and general applications that each is best suited to."}
