{"abstract":"Semantic communication is an important component in the next generation of wireless networking. Enabled by this novel paradigm, the conventional Internet-of-Things (IoT) is evolving toward the semantic IoT (SIoT) to achieve significant system performance improvements. However, traditional wireless communication security techniques for bit transmission cannot be applied directly to the SIoT that focuses on semantic information transmission. One key reason is the lack of new security performance indicators. Thus, we have to rethink the wireless communication security in the SIoT. As such, in this article, we analyze and compare classical security techniques, such as physical layer security, covert communications, and encryption, from the perspective of semantic information security. We highlight the differences among these security techniques when applied to the SIoT. Novel performance indicators, such as semantic secrecy outage probability (for physical layer security techniques) and detection failure probability (for covert communication techniques) are proposed. Considering that semantic communications can raise new security issues, we then review attack and defense methods at the semantic level. Lastly, we present several promising directions for future secure SIoT research."}
