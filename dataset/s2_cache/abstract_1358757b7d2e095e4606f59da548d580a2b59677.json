{"abstract":"Natural Language (NL) descriptions can be the most convenient or the only way to interact with systems built to understand and detect city scale traffic patterns and vehicle-related events. In this paper, we extend the widely adopted CityFlow Benchmark with natural language descriptions for vehicle targets and introduce the CityFlow-NL Benchmark. The CityFlow-NL contains more than 5,000 unique and precise NL descriptions of vehicle targets, making it the largest-scale tracking with NL descriptions dataset to our knowledge. Moreover, the dataset facilitates research at the intersection of multi-object tracking, retrieval by NL descriptions, and temporal localization of events."}
