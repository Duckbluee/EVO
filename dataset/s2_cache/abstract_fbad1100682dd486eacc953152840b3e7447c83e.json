{"abstract":"Community detection is a fundamental problem in machine learning. While deep learning has shown great promise in many graphrelated tasks, developing neural models for community detection has received surprisingly little attention. The few existing approaches focus on detecting disjoint communities, even though communities in real graphs are well known to be overlapping. We address this shortcoming and propose a graph neural network (GNN) based model for overlapping community detection. Despite its simplicity, our model outperforms the existing baselines by a large margin in the task of community recovery. We establish through an extensive experimental evaluation that the proposed model is effective, scalable and robust to hyperparameter settings. We also perform an ablation study that confirms that GNN is the key ingredient to the power of the proposed model."}
