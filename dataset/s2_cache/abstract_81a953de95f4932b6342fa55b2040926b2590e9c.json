{"abstract":"GitHub issue resolving recently has attracted significant attention from academia and industry. SWE-bench is proposed to measure the performance in resolving issues. In this paper, we propose CodeR, which adopts a multi-agent framework and pre-defined task graphs to Repair&Resolve reported bugs and add new features within code Repository. On SWE-bench lite, CodeR is able to solve 28.33% of issues, when submitting only once for each issue. We examine the performance impact of each design of CodeR and offer insights to advance this research direction."}
