{"abstract":"Brain age is considered as an important biomarker for detecting aging-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been widely investigated with deep neural networks for brain age estimation. However, most existing methods cannot make full use of multimodal MRIs due to the difference in data structure. In this paper, we propose a graph transformer geometric learning framework to model the multimodal brain network constructed by structural MRI (sMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for brain age estimation. First, we build a two-stream convolutional autoencoder to learn the latent representations for each imaging modality. The brain template with prior knowledge is utilized to calculate the features from the regions of interest (ROIs). Then, a multi-level construction of the brain network is proposed to establish the hybrid ROI connections in space, feature and modality. Next, a graph transformer network is proposed to model the cross-modal interaction and fusion by geometric learning for brain age estimation. Finally, the difference between the estimated age and the chronological age is used as an important biomarker for AD diagnosis. Our method is evaluated with the sMRI and DTI data from UK Biobank and Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Experimental results demonstrate that our method has achieved promising performances for brain age estimation and AD diagnosis."}
