{"abstract":"The rapid development of quantum computers promises transformative impacts across diverse fields of science and technology. Quantum neural networks (QNNs), as a forefront application, hold substantial potential. Despite the multitude of proposed models in the literature, persistent challenges, notably the vanishing gradient (VG) and cost function concentration (CFC) problems, impede their widespread success. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to quantum neural network construction, specifically addressing the issues of VG and CFC. Our methodology employs ensemble learning, advocating for the simultaneous deployment of multiple quantum circuits with a depth equal to \\(1\\), a departure from the conventional use of a single quantum circuit with depth \\(L\\). We assess the efficacy of our proposed model through a comparative analysis with a conventionally constructed QNN. The evaluation unfolds in the context of a classification problem, yielding valuable insights into the potential advantages of our innovative approach."}
