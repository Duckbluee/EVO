{"abstract":"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown impressive results for image generation. However, GANs face challenges in generating contents with certain types of constraints, such as game levels. Specifically, it is difficult to generate levels that have aesthetic appeal and are playable at the same time. Additionally, because training data usually is limited, it is challenging to generate unique levels with current GANs. In this paper, we propose a new GAN architecture named Conditional Embedding Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Net-work (CESAGAN) and a new bootstrapping training procedure. The CESAGAN is a modification of the self-attention GAN that incorporates an embedding feature vector input to condition the training of the discriminator and generator. This allows the network to model non-local dependency between game objects, and to count objects. Additionally, to reduce the number of levels necessary to train the GAN, we propose a bootstrapping mechanism in which playable generated levels are added to the training set. The results demonstrate that the new approach does not only generate a larger number of levels that are playable but also generates fewer duplicate levels compared to a standard GAN."}
