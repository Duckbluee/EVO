{"abstract":"The Internet of Behavior (IoB) is a research theme that aims to analyze human behavior data on the Internet from the perspective of behavioral psychology, obtain insights about human behavior, and better understand the intention behind the behavior. In this way, the IoB can predict human behavioral trends in the future and even change human behavior, which can provide more convenience for human life. With the increasing prosperity of the Internet of Things (IoT), more and more behavior-related data is collected on the Internet by connected devices such as sensors. People and behavior are connected through the extension of the IoT—the IoB. Presently, the IoB has gradually been applied to our lives, but it is still in its early stages, and many opportunities and challenges are emerging. This article provides an in-depth overview of the fundamental aspects of the IoB: 1) we introduce the development process and research status of the IoB from the perspective of the IoT; 2) we propose the characteristics of the IoB and define its development direction in terms of three aspects: a) real time; b) autonomy; and c) reliability; 3) we provide a comprehensive summary of the current applications of the IoB, including specific discussions in five scenarios that give an overview of the application status of the IoB; and 4) we discuss the challenges of the IoB’s development and its future directions, which hopefully will bring some progress to the IoB. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey paper on the IoB. We hope that this in-depth review can provide some useful directions for more productive research in related fields."}
