{"abstract":"Adversarial training has been actively studied in re-cent computer vision research to improve the robustness of models. However, due to the huge computational cost of generating adversarial samples, adversarial training methods are often slow. In this paper, we study the problem of learning a robust dataset such that any classiﬁer naturally trained on the dataset is adversarially robust. Such a dataset beneﬁts the downstream tasks as the natural training is much faster than adversarial training, and demon-strates that the desired property of robustness is transferable between models and data. In this work, we propose a principled tri-level optimization to formulate the robust dataset learning problem. We show that, under an abstraction model that characterizes robust vs. non-robust features, the proposed method provably learns a robust dataset. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our new algorithm with different network initializations and architectures."}
