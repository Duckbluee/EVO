{"abstract":"This article introduces StockGPT, an autoregressive number model trained and tested on 70 million daily US stock returns over nearly 100 years. Treating each return series as a sequence of tokens, StockGPT automatically learns the hidden patterns predictive of future returns via its attention mechanism. On a held-out test sample from 2001 to 2023, daily and monthly rebalanced long–short portfolios formed from StockGPT predictions yield solid performance. The StockGPT-based portfolios span momentum and long-/short-term reversals, reducing the need for manually crafted price-based strategies, and yield sizable alphas against leading stock market factors, suggesting a novel AI pricing effect. This highlights the immense promise of generative AI in surpassing humans in making complex financial investment decisions."}
