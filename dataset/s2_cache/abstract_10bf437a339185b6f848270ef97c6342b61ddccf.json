{"abstract":"The discriminative correlation filter (DCF) method is one of the main-stream methods in visual tracking with good performance and fast computational speed. However, most existing DCF trackers do not pay much attention to track a target in the low-resolution (LR) image. In order to address this problem, we propose a novel super-resolution tracker (SRT) based on DCF. SRT adopts a super-resolution reconstruction algorithm VDSR to enhance the resolution of the target. We compared SRT with 7 well-known DCF based trackers on 8 LR sequences selected from OTB2013. The results show that SRT outperforms state-of-the-art trackers in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations."}
