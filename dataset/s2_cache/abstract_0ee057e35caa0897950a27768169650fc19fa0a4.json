{"abstract":"Location recommendation is defined as to recommend locations (POIs) to users in location-based services. The existing data-driving approaches of location recommendation suffer from the limitation of the implicit modeling of the geographical factor, which may lead to sub-optimal recommendation results. In this work, we address this problem by introducing knowledge-driven solutions. Specifically, we first construct the Urban Knowledge Graph (UrbanKG) with geographical information and functional information of POIs. On the other side, there exist a fact that the geographical factor not only characterizes POIs but also affects user-POI interactions. To address it, we propose a novel method named UKGC. We first conduct information propagation on two sub-graphs to learn the representations of POIs and users. We then fuse two parts of representations by counterfactual learning for the final prediction. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify that our method can outperform the state-of-the-art methods."}
