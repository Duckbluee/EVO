{"abstract":"Quick global aggregation of effective distributed parameters is crucial to federated learning (FL), which requires adequate bandwidth for parameters communication and sufficient user data for local training. Otherwise, FL may cost excessive training time for convergence and produce inaccurate models. In this paper, we propose a brand-new FL framework, PromptFL, that replaces the federated model training with the federated prompt training, i.e., let federated participants train prompts instead of a shared model, to simultaneously achieve the efficient global aggregation and local training on insufficient data by exploiting the power of foundation models (FM) in a distributed way. PromptFL ships an off-the-shelf FM, i.e., CLIP, to distributed clients who would cooperatively train shared soft prompts based on very few local data. Since PromptFL only needs to update the prompts instead of the whole model, both the local training and the global aggregation can be significantly accelerated. And FM trained over large scale data can provide strong adaptation capability to distributed users tasks with the trained soft prompts. We empirically analyze the PromptFL via extensive experiments, and show its superiority in terms of system feasibility, user privacy, and performance."}
