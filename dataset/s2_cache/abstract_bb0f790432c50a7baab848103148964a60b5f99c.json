{"abstract":": This paper explores the transformative impact of serverless architecture on Large Language Models (LLMs) in the financial industry. We discuss how serverless computing revolutionizes AI applications in finance by providing scalable, efficient, and cost - effective solutions. The paper delves into the integration of LLMs in financial operations, emphasizing their role in automating complex processes, enhancing decision - making, and improving customer interaction. We discuss the advantages of serverless technology, such as reduced infrastructure costs and simplified management, which align with the computationally intensive nature of LLMs. Furthermore, we address the challenges and potential solutions in implementing serverless architecture within the financial sector. Through this exploration, the paper highlights how serverless computing, combined with the advanced capabilities of LLMs, is setting new standards in financial automation and intelligence."}
