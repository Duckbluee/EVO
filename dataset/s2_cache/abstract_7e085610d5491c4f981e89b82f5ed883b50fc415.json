{"abstract":"The k-nearest neighbor graph has emerged as the key data structure for many critical applications. However, it can be notoriously challenging to construct k-nearest neighbor graphs over large graph datasets, especially with a high-dimensional vector feature. Many solutions have been recently proposed to support the construction of k-nearest neighbor graphs. However, these solutions involve substantial memory access and computational overheads and an architecture-level solution is still absent. To address these issues, we architect FNNG, the first FPGA-based accelerator to support k-nearest neighbor graph construction. Specifically, FNNG is equipped with the block-based scheduling technique to exploit the inherent data locality between vertices. It divides the vertices that are close in space into blocks and process the vertices according to the granularity of the blocks during the construction process. FNNG also adopts the useless computation aborting technique to identify superfluous useless computations. It keeps the existing maximum similarity values of all vertices inside the computing unit. In addition, we propose an improved architecture in order to fully utilize both techniques. We implement FNNG on the Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGA card. The results show that FNNG achieves 190x and 2.1x speedups over the state-of-the-art CPU and GPU solutions, running on Intel Xeon Gold 5117 CPU and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, respectively."}
