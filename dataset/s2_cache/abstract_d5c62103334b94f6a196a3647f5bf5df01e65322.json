{"abstract":"With the deepening of research on Large Language Models (LLMs), significant progress has been made in recent years on the development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), which are gradually moving toward Artificial General Intelligence. This paper aims to summarize the recent progress from LLMs to LMMs in a comprehensive and unified way. First, we start with LLMs and outline various conceptual frameworks and key techniques. Then, we focus on the architectural components, training strategies, fine-tuning guidance, and prompt engineering of LMMs, and present a taxonomy of the latest vision–language LMMs. Finally, we provide a summary of both LLMs and LMMs from a unified perspective, make an analysis of the development status of large-scale models in the view of globalization, and offer potential research directions for large-scale models."}
