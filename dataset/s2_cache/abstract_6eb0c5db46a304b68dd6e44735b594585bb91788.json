{"abstract":"In recent years, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems have shown significant performance, accuracy, and efficiency gains, especially when Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are implemented. NeRF-based SLAM in mapping aims to implicitly understand irregular environmental information using large-scale parameters of deep learning networks in a data-driven manner so that specific environmental information can be predicted from a given perspective. NeRF-based SLAM in tracking jointly optimizes camera pose and implicit scene network parameters through inverse rendering or combines VO and NeRF mapping to achieve real-time positioning and mapping. This paper firstly analyzes the current situation of NeRF and SLAM systems and then introduces the state-of-the-art in NeRF-based SLAM. In addition, datasets and system evaluation methods used by NeRF-based SLAM are introduced. In the end, current issues and future work are analyzed. Based on an investigation of 30 related research articles, this paper provides in-depth insight into the innovation of SLAM and NeRF methods and provides a useful reference for future research."}
