{"abstract":"Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has shown significant strength in predicting the quantum mechanical properties of molecules. Based on GNN, the DimeNet++ leverages both distance information of atomic pairs and angle information of atomic triplets via message passing mechanism to predict quantum mechanical properties of molecules and has achieved state-of-the-art results. However, there are more than 10 thousand operators in DimeNet++, which results in low GPU utilization and large CPU launch overhead. The extensive time taken for the training of DimeNet++ is a significant drawback. The training period of DimeNet++ exceeds one month on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. A common method for reducing training time involves employing data parallelism, which equally distributes the global batch across each GPU. However, data-parallel task partitioning, by default, does not consider load imbalance within the batch. This load imbalance leads to considerable synchronization overhead in a multi-GPU setting, reducing the overall efficiency of the parallelism. For the strong-scaling scenario, it results in 32% of the compute resource being wasted. In light of these observations, we propose a novel approach, FastDimeNet++, which delivers high GPU utilization, low CPU overhead, and extensive scalability, achieved through a series of optimization strategies. These include (i) a communication-free load-balancing sampler, (ii) computation graph reconstruction, and (iii) kernel fusion and redundancy bypass. Our experiments demonstrate that FastDimeNet++ achieves a GPU utilization rate of approximately 88% based on a mini-batch size of 4. Furthermore, we scale FastDimeNet++ to 512 GPUs, reaching 2.8 PetaFLOPS. In the MLPerf HPC V1.0, the winning DimeNet++ submission required a total training time of 111.86 minutes, whereas FastDimeNet++ introduced for the MLPerf HPC V2.0 required just 21.93 minutes, demonstrating a significant performance improvement of over 5 ×."}
