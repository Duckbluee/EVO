{"abstract":"Text-to-image diffusion models have attracted considerable interest due to their wide applicability across diverse fields. However, challenges persist in creating controllable models for personalized object generation. In this paper, we first identify the entanglement issues in existing personalized generative models, and then propose a straightforward and efficient data augmentation training strategy that guides the diffusion model to focus solely on object identity. By inserting the plug-and-play adapter layers from a pre-trained controllable diffusion model, our model obtains the ability to control the location and size of each generated personalized object. During inference, we propose a regionally-guided sampling technique to maintain the quality and fidelity of the generated images. Our method achieves comparable or superior fidelity for personalized objects, yielding a robust, versatile, and controllable text-to-image diffusion model that is capable of generating realistic and personalized images. Our approach demonstrates significant potential for various applications, such as those in art, entertainment, and advertising design."}
