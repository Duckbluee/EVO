{"abstract":"This article examines the advantages and disadvantages of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in research and education and proposes the urgent need for an international statement to guide their responsible use. LLMs and AI demonstrate remarkable natural language processing, data analysis, and decision-making capabilities, offering potential benefits such as improved efficiency and transformative solutions. However, concerns regarding ethical considerations, bias, fake publications, and malicious use also arise. The objectives of this paper are to critically evaluate the utility of LLMs and AI in research and education, call for discussions between stakeholders, and discuss the need for an international statement. We identify advantages such as data processing, task automation, and personalized experiences, alongside disadvantages like bias reinforcement, interpretability challenges, inaccurate reporting, and plagiarism. Stakeholders from academia, industry, government, and civil society must engage in open discussions to address the ethical, legal, and societal implications. The proposed international statement should emphasize transparency, accountability, ongoing research, and risk mitigation. Monitoring, evaluation, user education, and awareness are essential components. By fostering discussions and establishing guidelines, we can ensure the responsible and ethical development and use of LLMs and AI, maximizing benefits while minimizing risks."}
