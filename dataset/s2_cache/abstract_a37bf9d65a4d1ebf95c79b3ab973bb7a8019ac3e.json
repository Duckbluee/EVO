{"abstract":"Image captioning is a research area of immense importance, aiming to generate natural language descriptions for visual content in the form of still images. The advent of deep learning and more recently vision-language pre-training techniques has revolutionized the field, leading to more sophisticated methods and improved performance. In this survey article, we provide a structured review of deep learning methods in image captioning by presenting a comprehensive taxonomy and discussing each method category in detail. Additionally, we examine the datasets commonly employed in image captioning research, as well as the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of different captioning models. We address the challenges faced in this field by emphasizing issues such as object hallucination, missing context, illumination conditions, contextual understanding, and referring expressions. We rank different deep learning methods’ performance according to widely used evaluation metrics, giving insight into the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we identify several potential future directions for research in this area, which include tackling the information misalignment problem between image and text modalities, mitigating dataset bias, incorporating vision-language pre-training methods to enhance caption generation, and developing improved evaluation tools to accurately measure the quality of image captions."}
