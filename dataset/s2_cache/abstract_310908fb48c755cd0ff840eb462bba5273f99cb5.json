{"abstract":"With the formal commercial use of the fifth generation mobile communication technology (5G) in China, the Internet of Things (IoT) industry has entered a period of innovation and development. The Internet of Things provides an open sharing platform for a large number of terminal devices. However, these devices will generate a large number of semi-structured log, it is urgent to automatic parsing. Parsing unstructured logs in different formats into structural templates is the first for later parsing. An online log parsing method based on prefix tree is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we extract the first character of the log template to form a string. Secondly, we structure the parse tree to obtain the string of the new log message. Thirdly, we compare with the string in the log template to dynamical update the similarity threshold. Finally, we update the parse tree in real time."}
