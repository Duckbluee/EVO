{"abstract":"Federated learning algorithms are developed both for efficiency reasons and to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of personal and business data, respectively. Despite no data being shared explicitly, recent studies showed that the mechanism could still leak sensitive information. Hence, secure aggregation is utilized in many real-world scenarios to prevent attribution to specific participants. In this paper, we focus on the quality (i.e., the ratio of correct labels) of individual training datasets and show that such quality information could be inferred and attributed to specific participants even when secure aggregation is applied. Specifically, through a series of image recognition experiments, we infer the relative quality ordering of participants. Moreover, we apply the inferred quality information to stabilize training performance, measure the individual contribution of participants, and detect misbehavior."}
