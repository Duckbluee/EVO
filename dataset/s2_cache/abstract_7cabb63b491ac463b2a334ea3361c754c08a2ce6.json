{"abstract":"Recent years have witnessed significant progress in quantum communication and quantum internet with the emerging quantum photonic chips, whose characteristics of scalability, stability, and low cost, flourish and open up new possibilities in miniaturized footprints. Here, we provide an overview of the advances in quantum photonic chips for quantum communication, beginning with a summary of the prevalent photonic integrated fabrication platforms and key components for integrated quantum communication systems. We then discuss a range of quantum communication applications, such as quantum key distribution and quantum teleportation. Finally, the review culminates with a perspective on challenges towards high-performance chip-based quantum communication, as well as a glimpse into future opportunities for integrated quantum networks."}
