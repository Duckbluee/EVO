{"abstract":"We present Boosting3D, a multi-stage single image-to-3D generation method that can robustly generate reasonable 3D objects in different data domains. The point of this work is to solve the view consistency problem in single image-guided 3D generation by modeling a reasonable geometric structure. For this purpose, we propose to utilize better 3D prior to training the NeRF. More specifically, we train an object-level LoRA for the target object using original image and the rendering output of NeRF. And then we train the LoRA and NeRF using a progressive training strategy. The LoRA and NeRF will boost each other while training. After the progressive training, the LoRA learns the 3D information of the generated object and eventually turns to an object-level 3D prior. In the final stage, we extract the mesh from the trained NeRF and use the trained LoRA to optimize the structure and appearance of the mesh. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Boosting3D learns object-specific 3D prior which is beyond the ability of pre-trained diffusion priors and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the single image-to-3d generation task."}
