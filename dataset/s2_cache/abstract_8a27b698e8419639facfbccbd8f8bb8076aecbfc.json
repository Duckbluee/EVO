{"abstract":"Cluster analysis and outlier detection are two continuously rising topics in data mining area, which in fact connect to each other deeply. Cluster structure is vulnerable to outliers; inversely, outliers are the points belonging to none of any clusters. Unfortunately, most existing studies do not notice the coupled relationship between these two tasks and handle them separately. In this article, we consider the joint cluster analysis and outlier detection problem, and propose the Clustering with Outlier Removal (COR) algorithm. Specifically, the original space is transformed into a binary space via generating basic partitions. We employ Holoentropy to measure the compactness of each cluster without involving several outlier candidates. To provide a neat and efficient solution, an auxiliary binary matrix is introduced so that COR completely and efficiently solves the challenging problem via a unified K-means— with theoretical supports. Extensive experimental results on numerous data sets in various domains demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of COR significantly over state-of-the-art methods in terms of cluster validity and outlier detection. Some key factors including the basic partition number and generation strategy in COR with an application on abnormal flight trajectory detection are further analyzed for practical use."}
