{"abstract":"As an important and challenging problem, gait recognition has gained considerable attention. It suffers from confounding conditions, that is, it is sensitive to camera views, dressing types and so on. Interestingly, it is observed that, under different conditions, local body parts contribute differently to recognition performance. In this paper, we propose a condition-aware comparison scheme to measure gait pairs’ similarity via a novel module named Instructor. Also, we present a geometry-guided data augmentation approach (Dresser) to enrich dressing conditions. Furthermore, to enhance the gait representation, we propose to model temporal local information from coarse to fine. Our model is evaluated on two popular benchmarks, CASIA-B and OULP. Results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, especially in the cross-condition scenario."}
