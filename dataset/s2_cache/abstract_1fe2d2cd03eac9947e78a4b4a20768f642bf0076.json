{"abstract":"This flower was created for the Monthly Folding Challenge 08/2009 of the Origami Forum (http://www.thekhans.me.uk/forum/). Subject of the challenge was to create a complex known model in under 30 folds (a step can contain several folds). The model I’ve chosen is Robert J. Lang’s “A Miura Ken Beauty Rose”. I really like how fast this model can be folded and that it is locked together so nicely. You can even instert a stem by opening the finished flower up a bit and then closing it again. The stem will hold in place very good since the flower has a lot of tension. There are two different ways to fold this model. The first way is easier to understand, the second version is faster and doesn’t leave unnecessary crease lines on the final model. 38 10 0"}
