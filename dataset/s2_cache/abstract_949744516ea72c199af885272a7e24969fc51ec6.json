{"abstract":"Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to solve the domain adaptation problem by transferring the knowledge learned from a pre-trained source model to an unseen target domain. Most existing methods assign pseudo-labels to the target data by generating feature prototypes. However, due to the discrepancy in the data distribution between the source domain and the target domain and category imbalance in the target domain, there are severe class biases in the generated feature prototypes and noisy pseudo-labels. Besides, the data structure of the target domain is often ignored, which is crucial for clustering. In this paper, a novel framework named PCSR is proposed to tackle SFDA via a novel intra-class Polycentric Clustering and Structural Regularization strategy. Firstly, an inter-class balanced sampling strategy is proposed to generate representative feature prototypes for each class. Furthermore, k-means clustering is introduced to generate multiple clustering centers for each class in the target domain to obtain robust pseudo-labels. Finally, to enhance the model's generalization, structural regularization is introduced for the target domain. Extensive experiments on three UDA benchmark datasets show that our method performs better or similarly against the other state of the art methods, demonstrating our approach's superiority for visual domain adaptation problems."}
