{"abstract":"Fairness in deep learning has attracted tremendous attention recently, as deep learning is increasingly being used in high-stake decision making applications that affect individual lives. We provide a review covering recent progresses to tackle algorithmic fairness problems of deep learning from the computational perspective. Specifically, we show that interpretability can serve as a useful ingredient to diagnose the reasons that lead to algorithmic discrimination. We also discuss fairness mitigation approaches categorized according to three stages of deep learning life-cycle, aiming to push forward the area of fairness in deep learning and build genuinely fair and reliable deep learning systems."}
