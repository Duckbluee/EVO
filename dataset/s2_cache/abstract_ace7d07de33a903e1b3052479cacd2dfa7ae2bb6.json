{"abstract":"Foundation models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have revolutionized text and video processing, yet time series data presents distinct challenges for such approaches due to domain-specific features such as missing values, multi-resolution characteristics, etc. Furthermore, the de-facto autoregressive transformers tend to learn deterministic temporal dependencies within pre-trained data while overlooking inherent uncertainties and lacking integration of physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce TimeDiT, a diffusion transformer model that synergistically combines transformer-based temporal dependency learning with diffusion-based probabilistic sampling. TimeDiT employs a unified masking mechanism to harmonize the training and inference process across diverse tasks while introducing a theoretically grounded, finetuning-free model editing strategy that enables flexible integration of external knowledge during sampling. Acknowledging the challenges of unifying multiple downstream tasks under a single model, our systematic evaluation demonstrates TimeDiT's effectiveness both in fundamental tasks, i.e., forecasting and imputation, through zero-shot/fine-tuning; and in domain tasks, i.e., multi-resolution forecasting, anomaly detection, and data generation, establishing it as a \\textit{proto-foundation model} that bridges the gap between general-purpose and domain-specific models."}
