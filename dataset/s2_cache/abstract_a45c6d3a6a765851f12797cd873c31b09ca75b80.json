{"abstract":"Visual tracking, one of the most favorable multimedia applications, has been widely used in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for civil infrastructure monitoring, aerial cinematography, autonomous navigation, etc. Most existing trackers utilize deep convolutional feature to enhance tracking robustness in scenarios of various appearance variation. However, they commonly neglect speed which is crucial for UAV with restricted calculation resources. In this work, a novel correlation filter-based keyfilter-aware tracker with a new intermittent context learning strategy is proposed to efficiently and effectively alleviate the problems of background clutter, deficient description, occlusion, illumination change, etc. Specifically, context information is utilized to empower the filter higher discriminating ability through response repression of the omnidirectional context patches. Furthermore, keyfilter is produced from the periodically selected keyframe. The latest produced keyfilter is used to restrain the current filter's corrupted changes. Most importantly, context learning of correlation filter is implemented intermittently to fully increase the tracking efficiency. This intermittent learning strategy can ensure every filter maintain context awareness owing to the restriction of keyfilter, periodically enhancing the context awareness. Substantial experiments on three challenging UAV benchmarks totally with 213 image sequences have shown that our tracker surpasses the state-of-the-art results, and exhibits a remarkable generality in short-term and long-term UAV tracking tasks as well as a variety of challenging attributes."}
