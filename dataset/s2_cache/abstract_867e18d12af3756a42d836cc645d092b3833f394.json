{"abstract":"Radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) finds various applications like assisted living and driver behavior monitoring. As radar data are heavily environment-dependent, it is becoming increasingly important to develop a transfer learning mechanism that enables a radar-based HAR system with desirable cross-environment adaptation feasibility. This paper concerns the issue of how radar-based HAR system can adapt to a new environment without source data. To this end, we devote to using the source hypothesis transfer learning architecture to build such an environment adaptation mechanism towards cross-environment radar-based HAR. In doing this, it is a challenging task to develop a reliable self-supervised labeling strategy for generating pseudo labels associated with the unlabeled target data, which is crucial to facilitate the learning of a target-specific feature extractor being responsible for environment adaptation. This paper presents the neighbor-aggregating-based labeling method and incorporates it with the existing clustering-based labeling method to perform the self-supervised labeling task. The logic behind our approach is that the above two labeling methods are complementary to each other in terms of making use of both local and global structures of adaptation data to supervise the labeling task. The coordination of both labeling methods is motivated to be implemented in the weighted combination form, which contributes to improving the reliability of generated labels. Experimental results on a public HAR dataset based on the frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}
