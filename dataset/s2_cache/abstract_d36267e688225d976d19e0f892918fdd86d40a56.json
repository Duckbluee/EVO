{"abstract":"The emergence of ChatGPT has recently garnered significant attention from the computational linguistics community. To demonstrate its capabilities as a keyphrase generator, we conduct a preliminary evaluation of ChatGPT for the keyphrase generation task. We evaluate its performance in various aspects, including keyphrase generation prompts, keyphrase generation diversity, and long document understanding. Our evaluation is based on six benchmark datasets, and we adopt the prompt suggested by OpenAI while extending it to six candidate prompts. We find that ChatGPT performs exceptionally well on all six candidate prompts, with minor performance differences observed across the datasets. Based on our findings, we conclude that ChatGPT has great potential for keyphrase generation. Moreover, we discover that ChatGPT still faces challenges when it comes to generating absent keyphrases. Meanwhile, in the final section, we also present some limitations and future expansions of this report."}
