{"abstract":". Stereo matching is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Despite recent progress by deep learning, improving the robust-ness is ineluctable when deploying stereo-matching models to real-world applications. Diﬀerent from the common practices, i.e., developing an elaborate model to achieve robustness, we argue that collecting multiple available datasets for training is a cheaper way to increase generalization ability. Speciﬁcally, this report presents an improved RaftStereo [12] trained with a mixed dataset of seven public datasets for the robust vision challenge (denoted as iRaftStereo RVC). When evaluated on the training sets of Middlebury, KITTI-2015, and ETH3D, the model out-performs its counterparts trained with only one dataset, such as the popular Sceneﬂow. After ﬁne-tuning the pre-trained model on the three datasets of the challenge, it ranks at 2nd place on the stereo leader-board 1 , demonstrating the beneﬁts of mixed dataset pre-training."}
