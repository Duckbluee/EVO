{"abstract":"certain conditions the employment of a similar range of thought, even if the former does not come before the mind directly either in its methods or in its results. the boundless domain of the effect of accumulated experience belongs here. this effect results from the frequent conscious occurrence of any condition or process, and consists in facilitating the occurrence and progress of similar processes. this effect is not fettered by the condition that the factors constituting the experience shall return in toto to consciousness. this may incidentally be the case with a part of them; it must not happen to a too great extent and with too great clearness, otherwise the course of the present process will immediately be disturbed. Most of these experiences remain concealed from consciousness and yet produce an effect which is significant and which authenticates their previous existence."}
