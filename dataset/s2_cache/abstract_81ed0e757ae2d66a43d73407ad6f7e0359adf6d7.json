{"abstract":"Parallel text is required for building high-quality machine translation (MT) systems, as well as for other multilingual NLP applications. For many South Asian languages, such data is in short supply. In this paper, we described a new publicly available corpus (PMIndia) consisting of parallel sentences which pair 13 major languages of India with English. The corpus includes up to 56000 sentences for each language pair. We explain how the corpus was constructed, including an assessment of two different automatic sentence alignment methods, and present some initial NMT results on the corpus."}
