{"abstract":"To understand how deep neural networks perform classification predictions, recent research attention has been focusing on developing techniques to offer desirable explanations. However, most existing methods cannot be easily applied for semantic segmentation; moreover, they are not designed to offer interpretability under the multi-annotator setting. Instead of viewing ground-truth pixel-level labels annotated by a single annotator with consistent labeling tendency, we aim at providing interpretable semantic segmentation and answer two critical yet practical questions:\"who\"contributes to the resulting segmentation, and\"why\"such an assignment is determined. In this paper, we present a learning framework of Tendency-and-Assignment Explainer (TAX), designed to offer interpretability at the annotator and assignment levels. More specifically, we learn convolution kernel subsets for modeling labeling tendencies of each type of annotation, while a prototype bank is jointly observed to offer visual guidance for learning the above kernels. For evaluation, we consider both synthetic and real-world datasets with multi-annotators. We show that our TAX can be applied to state-of-the-art network architectures with comparable performances, while segmentation interpretability at both levels can be offered accordingly."}
