{"abstract":"OASIS-3 is a compilation of MRI and PET imaging and related clinical data for 1098 participants who were collected across several ongoing studies in the Washington University Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center over the course of 15 years. Participants include 605 cognitively normal adults and 493 individuals at various stages of cognitive decline ranging in age from 42 to 95 years. The OASIS-3 dataset contains over 2000 MR sessions, including multiple structural and functional sequences. PET metabolic and amyloid imaging includes over 1500 raw imaging scans and the accompanying post-processed files from the PET Unified Pipeline (PUP) are also available in OASIS-3. OASIS-3 also contains post-processed imaging data such as volumetric segmentations and PET analyses. Imaging data is accompanied by dementia and APOE status and longitudinal clinical and cognitive outcomes. OASIS-3 is available as an open access data set to the scientific community to answer questions related to healthy aging and dementia."}
