{"abstract":"Researchers investigating the neural mechanisms underlying speech perception often employ electroencephalography (EEG) to record brain activity while participants listen to spoken language. The high temporal resolution of EEG enables the study of neural responses to fast and dynamic speech signals. Previous studies have successfully extracted speech characteristics from EEG data and, conversely, predicted EEG activity from speech features. Machine learning techniques are generally employed to construct encoding and decoding models, which necessitate a substantial amount of data. We present SparrKULee: A Speech-evoked Auditory Repository of EEG, measured at KU Leuven, comprising 64-channel EEG recordings from 85 young individuals with normal hearing, each of whom listened to 90-150 minutes of natural speech. This dataset is more extensive than any currently available dataset in terms of both the number of participants and the amount of data per participant. It is suitable for training larger machine learning models. We evaluate the dataset using linear and state-of-the-art non-linear models in a speech encoding/decoding and match/mismatch paradigm, providing benchmark scores for future research."}
