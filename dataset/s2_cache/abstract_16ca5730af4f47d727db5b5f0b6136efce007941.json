{"abstract":"How can we detect fraud in a big graph with rich properties, as online fraudsters invest more resources, including purchasing large pools of fake user accounts and dedicated IPs, to hide their fraudulent attacks? To achieve robustness, existing approaches detected dense sub-graphs as suspicious patterns in an unsupervised way, such as average degree maximization. However, such approaches suffer from the bias of including more nodes than necessary, resulting in lower accuracy and increased need for manual verification. Therefore, we propose HoloScope, which introduces a novel metric “contrast suspiciousness” integrating information from graph topology and spikes to more accurately detect fraudulent users and objects. Contrast suspiciousness dynamically emphasizes the contrasting patterns between fraudsters and normal users, making HoloScope capable of distinguishing the synchronized and strange behaviors of fraudsters by means of topology, bursts and drops, and rating scores. In addition, we provide theoretical bounds for how much this method increases the time cost needed for fraudsters to conduct adversarial attacks. Moreover, HoloScope has a concise framework and sub-quadratic time complexity, making the algorithm reproducible and scalable. In extensive experiments, HoloScope achieved significant accuracy improvements on real data with injected labels and true labels, when compared with state-of-the-art fraud detection methods."}
