{"abstract":"Despite advances in image classification methods, detecting the samples not belonging to the training classes is still a challenging problem. There has been a burst of interest in this subject recently, which is called Open-Set Recognition (OSR). In OSR, the goal is to achieve both the classification and detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Several ideas have been proposed to push the empirical result further through complicated techniques. We believe that such complication is indeed not necessary. To this end, we have shown that Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP), as the simplest baseline for OSR, applied on Vision Transformers (ViTs) as the base classifier that is trained with non-OOD augmentations can surprisingly outperform many recent methods. Non-OOD augmentations are the ones that do not alter the data distribution by much. Our results outperform state-of-the-art in CIFAR-10 datasets, and is also better than most of the current methods in SVHN and MNIST. We show that training augmentation has a significant effect on the performance of ViTs in the OSR tasks, and while they should produce significant diversity in the augmented samples, the generated sample OOD-ness must remain limited."}
