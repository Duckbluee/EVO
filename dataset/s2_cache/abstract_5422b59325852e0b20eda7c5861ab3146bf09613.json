{"abstract":"Point cloud segmentation plays a crucial role in extracting unique attributes and separating various objects, thereby enabling semantic comprehension and analysis. In this paper, we introduce a novel point cloud segmentation approach based on Diffusion Probabilistic Network (DDPM). The proposed model treats points as particles undergoing diffusion towards a noise distribution, and a reverse diffusion process transforms this noise distribution into the desired shape. Leveraging a Markov diffusion model in the reverse process enables generating point clouds with more refined and specific topological structures. After the diffusion step, multi-scale sampled features are fused to enhance the discriminative representation of 3D shapes. Objective and subjective experimental results demonstrate that our segmentation method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of evaluation metrics."}
