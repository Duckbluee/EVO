{"abstract":"Data is a resource that contains facts or evidence such as disaster events. This information can be used to support the disaster management phase. However, privacy and security issues become a concern when personal data information spread arbitrarily which could be easily abused by irresponsible people and produce inaccurate information (hoax) for other people. The urgency of data privacy in disaster situations is a thing that must consider for security, convenience, and common interest. In this study, a brief review was conducted to find gaps in the previous literature and then provided recommendations for handling data privacy in the disaster management process."}
