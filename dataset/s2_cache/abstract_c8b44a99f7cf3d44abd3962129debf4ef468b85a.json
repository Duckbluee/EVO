{"abstract":"Traffic anomalies, such as traffic accidents and unexpected crowd gathering, may endanger public safety if not handled timely. Detecting traffic anomalies in their early stage can benefit citizens’ quality of life and city planning. However, traffic anomaly detection faces two main challenges. First, it is challenging to model traffic dynamics due to the complex spatiotemporal characteristics of traffic data. Second, the criteria of traffic anomalies may vary with locations and times. In this article, we propose a spatiotemporal graph convolutional adversarial network (STGAN) to address these above challenges. More specifically, we devise a spatiotemporal generator to predict the normal traffic dynamics and a spatiotemporal discriminator to determine whether an input sequence is real or not. There are high correlations between neighboring data points in the spatial and temporal dimensions. Therefore, we propose a recent module and leverage graph convolutional gated recurrent unit (GCGRU) to help the generator and discriminator learn the spatiotemporal features of traffic dynamics and traffic anomalies, respectively. After adversarial training, the generator and discriminator can be used as detectors independently, where the generator models the normal traffic dynamics patterns and the discriminator provides detection criteria varying with spatiotemporal features. We then design a novel anomaly score combining the abilities of two detectors, which considers the misleading of unpredictable traffic dynamics to the discriminator. We evaluate our method on two real-world datasets from New York City and California. The experimental results show that the proposed method detects various traffic anomalies effectively and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the devised anomaly score achieves more robust detection performances than the general score."}
