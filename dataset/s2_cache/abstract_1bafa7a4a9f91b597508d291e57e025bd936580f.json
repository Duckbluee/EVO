{"abstract":"We propose for the first time, a novel deep active visuo-tactile cross-modal full-fledged framework for object recognition by autonomous robotic systems. Our proposed network xAVTNet is actively trained with labelled point clouds from a vision sensor with one robot and tested with an active tactile perception strategy to recognise objects never touched before using another robot. We propose a novel visuo-tactile loss (VTLoss) to minimise the discrepancy between the visual and tactile domains for unsupervised domain adaptation. Our framework leverages the strengths of deep neural networks for cross-modal recognition along with active perception and active learning strategies for increased efficiency by minimising redundant data collection. Our method is extensively evaluated on a real robotic system and compared against baselines and other state-of-art approaches. We demonstrate clear outperformance in recognition accuracy compared to the state-of-art visuo-tactile cross-modal recognition method."}
