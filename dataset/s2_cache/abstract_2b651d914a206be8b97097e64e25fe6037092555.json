{"abstract":"High-quality artificially generated images are widely available now and increasingly realistic, posing challenges for image forensics in distinguishing them from real ones. Unfortunately, building a single detector that generalizes well to unseen generators is very difficult, creating the need for diverse cues. In this paper, we show that natural and synthetic images differ in their color statistics, possibly due to the widely used perceptual loss, which is more sensitive to brightness than to chroma differences. Consequently, color statistics offer valuable cues for forensic analysis and the development of robust detectors. Our experiments using simple hand-crafted color functions with a random forest achieve 91% accuracy averaged over all tested Diffusion Models, even with limited training samples."}
