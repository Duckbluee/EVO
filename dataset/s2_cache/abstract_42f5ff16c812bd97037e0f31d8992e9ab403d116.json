{"abstract":"In practical assembly enterprises, customization and rush orders lead to an uncertain demand environment. This situation requires managers and researchers to configure an assembly line that increases production efficiency and robustness. Hence, this work addresses cost-oriented mixed-model multimanned assembly line balancing under uncertain demand, and presents a new robust mixed-integer linear programming model to minimize the production and penalty costs simultaneously. In addition, a reinforcement learning-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is designed to tackle the problem. The algorithm includes a priority-based solution representation and a new task-worker-sequence decoding that considers robustness processing and idle time reductions. Five crossover and three mutation operators are proposed. The $Q$ -learning-based strategy determines the crossover and mutation operator at each iteration to effectively obtain Pareto sets of solutions. Finally, a time-based probability-adaptive strategy is designed to effectively coordinate the crossover and mutation operators. The experimental study, based on 269 benchmark instances, demonstrates that the proposal outperforms 11 competitive MOEAs and a previous single-objective approach to the problem. The managerial insights from the results as well as the limitations of the algorithm are also highlighted."}
