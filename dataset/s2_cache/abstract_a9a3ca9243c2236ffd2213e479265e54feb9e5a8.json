{"abstract":"Predicting stock movements is a valuable research field that can help investors earn more profits. As with time‐series data, the stock market is time‐dependent and the value of historical information may decrease over time. Accurate prediction can be achieved by mining valuable information with words on social platforms and further integrating it with actual stock market conditions. However, many methods still cannot effectively dig deep into hidden information, integrate text and stock prices, and ignore the temporal dependence. Therefore, to solve the above problems, we propose a transformer‐based attention network framework that uses historical text and stock prices to capture the temporal dependence of financial data. Among them, the transformer model and attention mechanism are used for feature extraction of financial data, which has fewer applications in the financial field, and effective analysis of key information to achieve an accurate prediction. A large number of experiments have proved the effectiveness of our proposed method. The actual simulation experiment verifies that our model has practical application value."}
