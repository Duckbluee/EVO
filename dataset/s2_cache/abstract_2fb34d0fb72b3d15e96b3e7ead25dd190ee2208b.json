{"abstract":"Deep learning techniques have led to remarkable breakthroughs in the field of generic object detection and have spawned a lot of scene-understanding tasks in recent years. Scene graph has been the focus of research because of its powerful semantic representation and applications to scene understanding. Scene Graph Generation (SGG) refers to the task of automatically mapping an image into a semantic structural scene graph, which requires the correct labeling of detected objects and their relationships. Although this is a challenging task, the community has proposed a lot of SGG approaches and achieved good results. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent achievements in this field brought about by deep learning techniques. We review 138 representative works that cover different input modalities, and systematically summarize existing methods of image-based SGG from the perspective of feature extraction and fusion. We attempt to connect and systematize the existing visual relationship detection methods, to summarize, and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies of SGG in a comprehensive way. Finally, we finish this survey with deep discussions about current existing problems and future research directions. This survey will help readers to develop a better understanding of the current research status and ideas."}
