{"abstract":"Drug discovery for a protein target is a laborious and costly process. Deep learning (DL) methods have been applied to drug discovery and successfully generated novel molecular structures, and they can substantially reduce development time and costs. However, most of them rely on prior knowledge, either by drawing on the structure and properties of known molecules to generate similar candidate molecules or extracting information on the binding sites of protein pockets to obtain molecules that can bind to them. In this paper, DeepTarget, an end-to-end DL model, was proposed to generate novel molecules solely relying on the amino acid sequence of the target protein to reduce the heavy reliance on prior knowledge. DeepTarget includes three modules: Amino Acid Sequence Embedding (AASE), Structural Feature Inference (SFI), and Molecule Generation (MG). AASE generates embeddings from the amino acid sequence of the target protein. SFI inferences the potential structural features of the synthesized molecule, and MG seeks to construct the eventual molecule. The validity of the generated molecules was demonstrated by a benchmark platform of molecular generation models. The interaction between the generated molecules and the target proteins was also verified on the basis of two metrics, drug–target affinity and molecular docking. The results of the experiments indicated the efficacy of the model for direct molecule generation solely conditioned on amino acid sequence."}
