{"abstract":"Stock price has always been the focus of stock market forecasting research. Because stock price is affected by a variety of complex factors, its sequence is non-stationary and non-linear. The prediction accuracy of traditional econometric models is low. In order to improve the prediction accuracy and ensure the interpretability of the model, this paper proposes a GRU stock price prediction method based on HP filter. The long-term trend and short-term fluctuation of stock price are decomposed by HP filter, and then the trend sequence and volatility sequence are respectively predicted by the GRU model, so as to integrate the predicted values to obtain the final prediction result. The experimental results show that the GRU stock price prediction method based on HP filter proposed in this paper can effectively improve the prediction accuracy while ensuring the interpretability of the model, providing a new method and approach for stock price prediction."}
