{"abstract":"Determining the quality of the results obtained by clustering techniques is a key issue in unsupervised machine learning. Many authors have discussed the desirable features of good clustering algorithms. However, Jon Kleinberg established an impossibility theorem for clustering. As a consequence, a wealth of studies have proposed techniques to evaluate the quality of clustering results depending on the characteristics of the clustering problem and the algorithmic technique employed to cluster data."}
