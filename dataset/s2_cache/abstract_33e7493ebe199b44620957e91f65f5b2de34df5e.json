{"abstract":"Recently, diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable success for image generation and edition. However, existing diffusion-based video editing approaches lack the ability to offer precise control over generated content that maintains temporal consistency in long-term videos. On the other hand, atlas-based methods provide strong temporal consistency but are costly to edit a video and lack spatial control. In this work, we introduce VidEdit, a novel method for zero-shot text-based video editing that guarantees robust temporal and spatial consistency. In particular, we combine an atlas-based video representation with a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to provide a training-free and efficient video editing method, which by design fulfills temporal smoothness. To grant precise user control over generated content, we utilize conditional information extracted from off-the-shelf panoptic segmenters and edge detectors which guides the diffusion sampling process. This method ensures a fine spatial control on targeted regions while strictly preserving the structure of the original video. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments show that VidEdit outperforms state-of-the-art methods on DAVIS dataset, regarding semantic faithfulness, image preservation, and temporal consistency metrics. With this framework, processing a single video only takes approximately one minute, and it can generate multiple compatible edits based on a unique text prompt.
