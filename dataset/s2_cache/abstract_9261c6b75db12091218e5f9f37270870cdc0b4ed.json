{"abstract":"Variational particle-based Bayesian learning methods have the advantage of not being limited by the bias affecting more conventional parametric techniques. This paper proposes to leverage the flexibility of non-parametric Bayesian approximate inference to develop a novel Bayesian federated unlearning method, referred to as Forget-Stein Variational Gradient Descent (Forget-SVGD). Forget-SVGD builds on SVGD - a particle-based approximate Bayesian inference scheme using gradient-based deterministic updates - and on its distributed (federated) extension known as Distributed SVGD (DSVGD). Upon the completion of federated learning, as one or more participating agents request for their data to be\"forgotten\", Forget-SVGD carries out local SVGD updates at the agents whose data need to be\"unlearned\", which are interleaved with communication rounds with a parameter server. The proposed method is validated via performance comparisons with non-parametric schemes that train from scratch by excluding data to be forgotten, as well as with existing parametric Bayesian unlearning methods."}
