{"abstract":"Monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms perform robustly when observing rigid scenes; however, they fail when the observed scene deforms, for example, in medical endoscopy applications. In this article, we present DefSLAM, the first monocular SLAM capable of operating in deforming scenes in real time. Our approach intertwines Shape-from-Template (SfT) and Non-Rigid Structure-from-Motion (NRSfM) techniques to deal with the exploratory sequences typical of SLAM. A deformation tracking thread recovers the pose of the camera and the deformation of the observed map, at frame rate, by means of SfT processing a template that models the scene shape-at-rest. A deformation mapping thread runs in parallel with the tracking to update the template, at keyframe rate, by means of an isometric NRSfM processing a batch of full perspective keyframes. In our experiments, DefSLAM processes close-up sequences of deforming scenes, both in a laboratory-controlled experiment and in medical endoscopy sequences, producing accurate 3-D models of the scene with respect to the moving camera."}
