{"abstract":"Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in image generation tasks, paving the way for powerful AIGC applications. However, these widely-used generative models can also raise security and privacy concerns, such as copyright infringement, and sensitive data leakage. To tackle these issues, we propose a method, Unlearnable Diffusion Perturbation, to safeguard images from unauthorized exploitation. Our approach involves designing an algorithm to generate sample-wise perturbation noise for each image to be protected. This imperceptible protective noise makes the data almost unlearnable for diffusion models, i.e., diffusion models trained or fine-tuned on the protected data cannot generate high-quality and diverse images related to the protected training data. Theoretically, we frame this as a max-min optimization problem and introduce EUDP, a noise scheduler-based method to enhance the effectiveness of the protective noise. We evaluate our methods on both Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model and Latent Diffusion Models, demonstrating that training diffusion models on the protected data lead to a significant reduction in the quality of the generated images. Especially, the experimental results on Stable Diffusion demonstrate that our method effectively safeguards images from being used to train Diffusion Models in various tasks, such as training specific objects and styles. This achievement holds significant importance in real-world scenarios, as it contributes to the protection of privacy and copyright against AI-generated content."}
