{"abstract":"In this article, we propose FlexHRC+, a hierarchical human–robot cooperation architecture designed to provide collaborative robots with an extended degree of autonomy when supporting human operators in high-variability shop-floor tasks. The architecture encompasses three levels, namely for perception, representation, and action. Building up on previous work, here we focus on an in-the-loop decision-making process for the operations of collaborative robots coping with the variability of actions carried out by human operators, and the representation level, integrating a hierarchical and/or graph whose online behavior is formally specified using first-order logic. The architecture is accompanied by experiments including collaborative furniture assembly and object positioning tasks."}
