{"abstract":"We subject GPT-4 to a number of rigorous psychometric tests and analyze the results. We find that, compared to the average human, GPT-4 tends to show more honesty and humility, and less machiavellianism and narcissism. It sometimes exhibits ambivalent sexism, leans slightly toward masculinity, is moderately anxious but mostly not depressive (but not always). It shows human-average numerical literacy and has cognitive reflection abilities that are above human average for verbal tasks."}
