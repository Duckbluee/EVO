{"abstract":"Graph neural networks (GNNs) is an information - processing system that uses message passing among graph nodes. In recent years, GNN variants including graph attention network (GAT), graph convolutional network (GCN), and graph recurrent network (GRN) have shown revolutionary performance in computer vision applications using deep learning and artificial intelligence. These neural network model extensions, collect information in the form of graphs. GNN may be divided into three groups based on the challenges it solves: link prediction, node classification, graph classification. Machines can differentiate and recognise objects in image and video using standard CNNs. Extensive amount of research work needs to be done before robots can have same visual intuition as humans. GNN architectures, on the other hand, may be used to solve various image categorization and video challenges. The number of GNN applications in computer vision not limited, continues to expand. Human-object interaction, actin understanding, image categorization from a few shots and many more. In this paper use of GNN in image and video understanding, design aspects, architecture, applications and implementation challenges towards computer vision is described. GNN is a strong tool for analysing graph data and is still a relatively active area that needs further researches attention to solve many computer vision applications."}
