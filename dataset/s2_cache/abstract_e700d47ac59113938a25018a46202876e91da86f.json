{"abstract":"Recommendation system has drawn growing attention in the academia and industry because it can solve the problem of information overload. Among a variety of methods, the click-through rate prediction model plays an important role in predicting user’s attention to a specific item. To predict click-through rate, high-dimensional and sparse features are usually adopted, and the accuracy of the prediction result depends on the combination of high-order features to a great extent. Therefore, many methods have been proposed to find the low-dimensional representation from sparse high-dimensional original features, and the meaningful way of feature combination has also been mined to improve the accuracy of the model. However, the click-through rate prediction models generally have two problems. One is that they can’t extract the feature interaction of non-Euclidean features very well. Another one is that it is hard to explain the inward meaning of feature interaction. In this paper, a GCN-int model based on the interaction of Graph Convolutional Network is proposed to solve the above problems. The proposed model simplifies the complex interaction among multiple features, gets a better representation of the interaction between high-order features, and improves the interpretability of feature interaction. The experimental results on the public movie recommendation dataset and our own IPTV movie recommendation dataset show that the proposed GCN-int model gets higher accuracy and efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art models."}
