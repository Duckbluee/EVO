{"abstract":"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various computer vision tasks, which are extremely powerful to deal with massive training data by using tens of millions of parameters. However, CNNs often cost significant memory and computation consumption, which prohibits their usage in resource-limited environments such as mobile or embedded devices. To address the above issues, the existing approaches typically focus on either accelerating the convolutional layers or compressing the fully-connected layers separatedly, without pursuing a joint optimum. In this paper, we overcome such a limitation by introducing a holistic CNN compression framework, termed LRDKT, which works throughout both convolutional and fully-connected layers. First, a low-rank decomposition (LRD) scheme is proposed to remove redundancies across both convolutional kernels and fully-connected matrices, which has a novel closed-form solver to significantly improve the efficiency of the existing iterative optimization solvers. Second, a novel knowledge transfer (KT) based training scheme is introduced. To recover the accumulated accuracy loss and overcome the vanishing gradient, KT explicitly aligns outputs and intermediate responses from a teacher (original) network to its student (compressed) network. We have comprehensively analyzed and evaluated the compression and speedup ratios of the proposed model on MNIST and ILSVRC 2012 benchmarks. In both benchmarks, the proposed scheme has demonstrated superior performance gains over the state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the proposed compression scheme for the task of transfer learning, including domain adaptation and object detection, which show exciting performance gains over the state-of-the-arts.
