{"abstract":"With the increasing popularity of graph-based learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) win lots of attention from research and industry field because of their high accuracy. However, existing GNNs suffer from high memory footprints (e.g., node embedding features). This high memory footprint hurdles the potential applications towards memory-constrained devices, such as the widely-deployed IoT devices. To this end, we propose a specialized GNN quantization scheme, SGQuant, to systematically reduce the GNN memory consumption. Specifically, we first propose a GNN-tailored quantization algorithm design and a GNN quantization fine-tuning scheme to reduce memory consumption while maintaining accuracy. Then, we investigate the multi-granularity quantization strategy that operates at different levels (components, graph topology, and layers) of GNN computation. Moreover, we offer an automatic bit-selecting (ABS) to pinpoint the most appropriate quantization bits for the above multi-granularity quantizations. Intensive experiments show that SGQuant can effectively reduce the memory footprint from 4.25× to 31.9× compared with the original full-precision GNNs while limiting the accuracy drop to 0.4% on average."}
