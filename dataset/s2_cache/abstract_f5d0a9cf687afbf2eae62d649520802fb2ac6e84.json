{"abstract":"Using Natural Language Process (NLP) as an efficient way to research paper is important when user feedback is sparse or unavailable. The task of text mining research paper is challenging, mainly due to the problem of unique characteristics such as jargon. Nowadays, there exist many language models that learn deep semantic representations by being trained on huge corpora. In this paper, we specify the NLP pre-processing process with Economics journal paper and apply it to a deep learning model to extract keywords. Here, we focus on the strength of NLP when applied to an unknown field. The analysis result shows the possibility and potential usefulness of the relationship research between keywords in research papers."}
