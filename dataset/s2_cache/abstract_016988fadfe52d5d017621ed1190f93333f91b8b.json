{"abstract":"In authentication scenarios, applications of practical speaker verification systems usually require a person to read a dynamic authentication text. Previous studies played an audio adversarial example as a digital signal to perform physical attacks, which would be easily rejected by audio replay detection modules. This work shows that by playing our crafted adversarial perturbation as a separate source when the adversary is speaking, the practical speaker verification system will misjudge the adversary as a target speaker. A two-step algorithm is proposed to optimize the universal adversarial perturbation to be text-independent and has little effect on the authentication text recognition. We also estimated room impulse response (RIR) in the algorithm which allowed the perturbation to be effective after being played over the air. In the physical experiment, we achieved targeted attacks with success rate of 100%, while the word error rate (WER) on speech recognition was only increased by 3.55%. And recorded audios could pass replay detection for the live person speaking."}
