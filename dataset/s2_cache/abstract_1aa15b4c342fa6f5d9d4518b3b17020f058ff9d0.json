{"abstract":"In this article, the innovation-based linear attack against state estimation in cyber-physical systems is studied. The scenario is considered where a sensor transmits its measurements to a remote estimator via a wireless channel. We propose an attack strategy to worsen the estimation performance of system when a passive detector is adopted. Different from the existing results, the side information is adopted synergistically besides the intercepted data. Meanwhile, the attacker needs to remain stealthy to the false-data detector. We analyze the performance degradation of system under the proposed attack strategy by deriving the remote estimation error covariance recursion. With the stealthiness constraint, the optimal stealthy attack can be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem accordingly. Besides, we provide a specific algorithm to calculate the falsified measurements. Finally, the effectiveness of explored attack strategy is demonstrated via simulation examples."}
