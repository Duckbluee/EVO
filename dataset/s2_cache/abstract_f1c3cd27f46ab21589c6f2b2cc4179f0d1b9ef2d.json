{"abstract":"Reconstructing the scene of robotic surgery from the stereo endoscopic video is an important and promising topic in surgical data science, which potentially supports many applications such as surgical visual perception, robotic surgery education and intra-operative context awareness. However, current methods are mostly restricted to reconstructing static anatomy assuming no tissue deformation, tool occlusion and de-occlusion, and camera movement. However, these assumptions are not always satisfied in minimal invasive robotic surgeries. In this work, we present an efficient reconstruction pipeline for highly dynamic surgical scenes that runs at 28 fps. Specifically, we design a transformer-based stereoscopic depth perception for efficient depth estimation and a light-weight tool segmentor to handle tool occlusion. After that, a dynamic reconstruction algorithm which can estimate the tissue deformation and camera movement, and aggregate the information over time is proposed for surgical scene reconstruction. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on two datasets, the public Hamlyn Centre Endoscopic Video Dataset and our in-house DaVinci robotic surgery dataset. The results demonstrate that our method can recover the scene obstructed by the surgical tool and handle the movement of camera in realistic surgical scenarios effectively at real-time speed."}
