{"abstract":"Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has become the new state-of-the-art approach in many recommendation problems, with its strong ability to handle structured data and to explore high-order information. However, as the recommendation tasks are diverse and various in the real world, it is quite challenging to design proper GNN methods for specific problems. In this tutorial, we focus on the critical challenges of GNN-based recommendation and the potential solutions. Specifically, we start from an extensive background of recommender systems and graph neural networks. Then we fully discuss why GNNs are required in recommender systems and the four parts of challenges, including graph construction, network design, optimization, and computation efficiency. Then, we discuss how to address these challenges by elaborating on the recent advances of GNN-based recommendation models, with a systematic taxonomy from four critical perspectives: stages, scenarios, objectives, and applications. Last, we finalize this tutorial with conclusions and discuss important future directions."}
