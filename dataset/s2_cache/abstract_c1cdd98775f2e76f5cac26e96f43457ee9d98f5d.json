{"abstract":"In this paper, we present a pursuit-evasion game with intelligent agents in the Unity 3D environment. The pursuit-evasion game consists of one evader and four pursuers which are the red, blue, orange and pink agents. In the game scenario, the goal of the evader, which is controlled by human user, is to collect papers without getting caught by the four pursuer agents. The pursuer agents are constructed such that they can move autonomously in the game field via the deployment of a dynamic waypoint structure and the A* algorithm. The red, blue and orange pursuer agents share the information on location of the evader agent if the evader agent lies in one of their limited line of sight. They try to intercept the evader agent from different directions in collaborative manner. In this context, we designed a PD controller based pursuing system that tries to minimize the distance between the evader and pursuer agent. For the pink agent, we designed a fuzzy logic based pursuing system that is capable to generate reference interception points and force values to catch evader agent. The performance of the pursuing systems is examined by providing experimental results collected from the game-environment. The results show that the performance of the developed pursuing strategies is satisfactory and the fuzzy logic based pursuing system resulted with a better performance when compared to its conventional counterpart."}
