{"abstract":"Learning from imbalanced data streams differs from the traditional learning paradigm due to the issues of imbalanced classes. It has significant implications in a myriad of real-world applications, ranging from financial risk, network security, to medical diagnosis. Moreover, outliers usually appear in data streams. The issue of class imbalance or anomaly itself could negatively affect the performance of the underlying learning algorithms, and their combination makes the learning problem harder. In this work, we propose an anomaly detection aided budget online weighted learning method (BOW-LM) to identify positive and negative instances from imbalanced data streams. BOW-LM is based on the widely used Feedforward Networks with Random Weights. An agile lightweight anomaly detector is designed based on the nonlinear mapping of the network. To reduce computational complexity and to response promptly, BOW-LM employs a matrix correction technique to update the learning model by only $\\mathcal {O}(L^2)$O(L2) operations for each data chunk with $L$L hidden layer nodes. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BOW-LM."}
