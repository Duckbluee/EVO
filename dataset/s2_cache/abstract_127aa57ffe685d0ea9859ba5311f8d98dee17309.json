{"abstract":"The rapid development of online recruitment services has encouraged the utilization of recommender systems to streamline the job seeking process. Predominantly, current job recommendations deploy either collaborative filtering or person-job matching strategies. However, these models tend to operate as\"black-box\"systems and lack the capacity to offer explainable guidance to job seekers. Moreover, conventional matching-based recommendation methods are limited to retrieving and ranking existing jobs in the database, restricting their potential as comprehensive career AI advisors. To this end, here we present GIRL (GeneratIve job Recommendation based on Large language models), a novel approach inspired by recent advancements in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs). We initially employ a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategy to instruct the LLM-based generator in crafting suitable Job Descriptions (JDs) based on the Curriculum Vitae (CV) of a job seeker. Moreover, we propose to train a model which can evaluate the matching degree between CVs and JDs as a reward model, and we use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) method to further fine-tine the generator. This aligns the generator with recruiter feedback, tailoring the output to better meet employer preferences. In particular, GIRL serves as a job seeker-centric generative model, providing job suggestions without the need of a candidate set. This capability also enhances the performance of existing job recommendation models by supplementing job seeking features with generated content. With extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset, we demonstrate the substantial effectiveness of our approach. We believe that GIRL introduces a paradigm-shifting approach to job recommendation systems, fostering a more personalized and comprehensive job-seeking experience."}
