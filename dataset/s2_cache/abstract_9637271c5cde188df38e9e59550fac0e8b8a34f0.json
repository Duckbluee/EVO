{"abstract":"We introduce DAiSEE, the first multi-label video classification dataset comprising of 9068 video snippets captured from 112 users for recognizing the user affective states of boredom, confusion, engagement, and frustration in the wild. The dataset has four levels of labels namely - very low, low, high, and very high for each of the affective states, which are crowd annotated and correlated with a gold standard annotation created using a team of expert psychologists. We have also established benchmark results on this dataset using state-of-the-art video classification methods that are available today. We believe that DAiSEE will provide the research community with challenges in feature extraction, context-based inference, and development of suitable machine learning methods for related tasks, thus providing a springboard for further research. The dataset is available for download at this https URL"}
