{"abstract":"The escalating complexity of software systems and accelerating development cycles pose a significant challenge in managing code errors and implementing business logic. Traditional techniques, while cornerstone for software quality assurance, exhibit limitations in handling intricate business logic and extensive codebases. To address these challenges, we introduce the Intelligent Code Analysis Agent (ICAA), a novel concept combining AI models, engineering process designs, and traditional non-AI components. The ICAA employs the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 or GPT-4 to automatically detect and diagnose code errors and business logic inconsistencies. In our exploration of this concept, we observed a substantial improvement in bug detection accuracy, reducing the false-positive rate to 66\\% from the baseline's 85\\%, and a promising recall rate of 60.8\\%. However, the token consumption cost associated with LLMs, particularly the average cost for analyzing each line of code, remains a significant consideration for widespread adoption. Despite this challenge, our findings suggest that the ICAA holds considerable potential to revolutionize software quality assurance, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of bug detection in the software development process. We hope this pioneering work will inspire further research and innovation in this field, focusing on refining the ICAA concept and exploring ways to mitigate the associated costs."}
