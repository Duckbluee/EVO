{"abstract":"Modern deep learning methods constitute incredibly powerful tools to tackle a myriad of challenging problems. However, since deep learning methods operate as black boxes, the uncertainty associated with their predictions is often challenging to quantify. Bayesian statistics offer a formalism to understand and quantify the uncertainty associated with deep neural network predictions. This tutorial provides deep learning practitioners with an overview of the relevant literature and a complete toolset to design, implement, train, use and evaluate Bayesian neural networks, i.e., stochastic artificial neural networks trained using Bayesian methods."}
