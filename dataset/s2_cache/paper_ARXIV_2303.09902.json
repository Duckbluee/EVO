However, these methods usually heavily rely on labeled data (i.e., user-item interactions), suffering from problems such as data sparsity and cold-start. Self-supervised learning, an emerging paradigm that extracts information from unlabeled data, provides insights into addressing these problems. Specifically, contrastive self-supervised learning, due to its flexibility and promising performance, has attracted considerable interest and recently become a dominant branch in self-supervised learning-based recommendation methods. In this survey, we provide an up-to-date and comprehensive review of current contrastive self-supervised learning-based recommendation methods. Firstly, we propose a unified framework for these methods. We then introduce a taxonomy based on the key components of the framework, including view generation strategy, contrastive task, and contrastive objective. For each component, we provide detailed descriptions and discussions to guide the choice of the appropriate method. Finally, we outline open issues and promising directions for future research."}
