{"abstract":"In this work, we propose Sum-Product-Transform Networks (SPTN), an extension of sum-product networks that uses invertible transformations as additional internal nodes. The type and placement of transformations determine properties of the resulting SPTN with many interesting special cases. Importantly, SPTN with Gaussian leaves and affine transformations pose the same inference task tractable that can be computed efficiently in SPNs. We propose to store affine transformations in their SVD decompositions using an efficient parametrization of unitary matrices by a set of Givens rotations. Last but not least, we demonstrate that G-SPTNs achieve state-of-the-art results on the density estimation task and are competitive with state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection."}
