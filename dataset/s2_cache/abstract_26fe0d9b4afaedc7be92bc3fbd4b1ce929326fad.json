{"abstract":"Modern recommender systems face an increasing need to explain their recommendations. Despite considerable progress in this area, evaluating the quality of explanations remains a significant challenge for researchers and practitioners. Prior work mainly conducts human study to evaluate explanation quality, which is usually expensive, time-consuming, and prone to human bias. In this paper, we propose an offline evaluation method that can be computed without human involvement. To evaluate an explanation, our method quantifies its counterfactual impact on the recommendation. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we carry out an online user study. We show that, compared to conventional methods, our method can produce evaluation scores more correlated with the real human judgments, and therefore can serve as a better proxy for human evaluation. In addition, we show that explanations with high evaluation scores are considered better by humans. Our findings highlight the promising direction of using the counterfactual approach as one possible way to evaluate recommendation explanations."}
