{"abstract":"A common explanation for the failure of deep networks to generalize out-of-distribution is that they fail to recover the “correct” features. We challenge this notion with a simple experiment which suggests that ERM already learns sufﬁcient features and that the current bottleneck is not feature learning, but robust regression . Our ﬁndings also imply that given a small amount of data from the target distribution, retraining only the last linear layer will give excellent performance. We therefore argue that devising simpler methods for learning predictors on existing features is a promising direction for future research. Towards this end, we introduce Domain-Adjusted Regression (DARE), a convex objective for learning a linear predictor that is provably robust under a new model of distribution shift. Rather than learning one function, DARE performs a domain-speciﬁc adjustment to unify the domains in a canonical latent space and learns to predict in this space. Under a natural model, we prove that the DARE solution is the minimax-optimal predictor for a constrained set of test distributions. Further, we provide the ﬁrst ﬁnite-environment convergence guarantee to the minimax risk, improving over existing analyses which only yield minimax predictors after an environment threshold. Evaluated on ﬁnetuned features, we ﬁnd that DARE compares favorably to prior methods, consistently achieving equal or better performance."}
