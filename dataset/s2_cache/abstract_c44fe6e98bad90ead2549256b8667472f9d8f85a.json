{"abstract":"Quantum computers hold the promise of more efficient combinatorial optimization solvers, which could be game-changing for a broad range of applications. However, a bottleneck for materializing such advantages is that, in order to challenge classical algorithms in practice, mainstream approaches require a number of qubits prohibitively large for near-term hardware. Here we introduce a variational solver for MaxCut problems over m=O(nk)\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$m={{\\mathcal{O}}}({n}^{k})$$\\end{document} binary variables using only n qubits, with tunable k > 1. The number of parameters and circuit depth display mild linear and sublinear scalings in m, respectively. Moreover, we analytically prove that the specific qubit-efficient encoding brings in a super-polynomial mitigation of barren plateaus as a built-in feature. Altogether, this leads to high quantum-solver performances. For instance, for m = 7000, numerical simulations produce solutions competitive in quality with state-of-the-art classical solvers. In turn, for m = 2000, experiments with n = 17 trapped-ion qubits feature MaxCut approximation ratios estimated to be beyond the hardness threshold 0.941. Our findings offer an interesting heuristics for quantum-inspired solvers as well as a promising route towards solving commercially-relevant problems on near-term quantum devices. Combinatorial optimization problems might be solvable more efficiently with quantum computing, but near-term quantum optimization solvers are limited in qubit size. Here, the authors propose and demonstrate a variational quantum algorithm that polynomially reduces the qubit overhead for applications like MaxCut."}
