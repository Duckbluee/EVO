{"abstract":"Complex event processing (CEP) is defined as event processing for multiple stream sources to infer events that suggest complicated circumstances. As the size of stream data becomes larger, CEP engines have been parallelized to take advantage of distributed computing. Typically, deployment of such a distributed CEP engine involves manual configuration, which has been regarded as an obstacle to its widespread adoption. In this demonstration, we present CEP-Wizard, a framework of automatically configuring and deploying a distributed CEP engine with minimum effort. The demonstration shows that even inexperienced users can easily configure and deploy it on Apache Storm with achieving high performance and low resource usage."}
