{"abstract":"Computational generation of stories is a subfield of computational creativity where artificial intelligence and psychology intersect to teach computers how to mimic humans’ creativity. It helps generate many stories with minimum effort and customize the stories for the users’ education and entertainment needs. Although the automatic generation of stories started to receive attention many decades ago, advances in this field to date are less than expected and suffer from many limitations. This survey presents an extensive study of research in the area of non-interactive textual story generation, as well as covering resources, corpora, and evaluation methods that have been used in those studies. It also shed light on factors of story interestingness."}
