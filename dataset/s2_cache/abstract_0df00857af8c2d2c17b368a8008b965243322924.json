{"abstract":"Document-level relation extraction has attracted much attention in recent years. It is usually formulated as a classification problem that predicts relations for all entity pairs in the document. However, previous works indiscriminately represent intra- and inter-sentential relations in the same way, confounding the different patterns for predicting them. Besides, they create a document graph and use paths between entities on the graph as clues for logical reasoning. However, not all entity pairs can be connected with a path and have the correct logical reasoning paths in their graph. Thus many cases of logical reasoning cannot be covered. This paper proposes an effective architecture, SIRE, to represent intra- and inter-sentential relations in different ways. We design a new and straightforward form of logical reasoning module that can cover more logical reasoning chains. Experiments on the public datasets show SIRE outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis shows that our predictions are reliable and explainable.
