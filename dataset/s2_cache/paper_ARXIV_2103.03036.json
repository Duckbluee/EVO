Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a de facto model for analyzing graphstructured data, are highly sensitive to the quality of the given graph structures. Therefore, noisy or incomplete graphs often lead to unsatisfactory representations and prevent us from fully understanding the mechanism underlying the system. In pursuit of an optimal graph structure for downstream tasks, recent studies have sparked an effort around the central theme of Graph Structure Learning (GSL), which aims to jointly learn an optimized graph structure and corresponding graph representations. In the presented survey, we broadly review recent progress in GSL methods. Specifically, we first formulate a general pipeline of GSL and review state-of-the-art methods classified by the way of modeling graph structures, followed by applications of GSL across domains. Finally, we point out some issues in current studies and discuss future directions."}
