{"abstract":"St. Charles County’s sustained prosperity and its ability to attract new residents are due in a large part to the high quality of life it offers. Residential development in the county can strive to provide housing opportunities for all its citizens in a variety of housing choices and in a range of prices. Such residential development should be accomplished while protecting the natural environment and providing a balance of land use patterns which minimizes land use conflict."}
