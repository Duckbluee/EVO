{"abstract":"A graph-based sampling and consensus (GraphSAC) approach is introduced to effectively detect anomalous nodes in large-scale graphs. Existing approaches rely on connectivity and attributes of all nodes to assign an anomaly score per node. However, nodal attributes and network links might be compromised by adversaries, rendering these holistic approaches vulnerable. Alleviating this limitation, GraphSAC randomly draws subsets of nodes, and relies on graph-aware criteria to judiciously filter out sets contaminated by anomalous nodes, before employing a semi-supervised learning (SSL) module to estimate nominal label distributions per node. These learned nominal distributions are minimally affected by the anomalous nodes, and hence can be directly adopted for anomaly detection. Rigorous analysis provides performance guarantees for GraphSAC, by bounding the required number of draws. The per-draw complexity grows linearly with the number of edges, which implies efficient SSL, while draws can be run in parallel, thereby ensuring scalability to large graphs. GraphSAC is tested under different anomaly generation models based on random walks, clustered anomalies, as well as contemporary adversarial attacks for graph data. Experiments with real-world graphs showcase the advantage of GraphSAC relative to state-of-the-art alternatives."}
