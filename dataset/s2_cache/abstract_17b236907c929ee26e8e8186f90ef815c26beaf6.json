{"abstract":"Weighting strategy prevails in machine learning. For example, a common approach in robust machine learning is to exert lower weights on samples which are likely to be noisy or quite hard. This study reveals another undiscovered strategy, namely, compensating. Various incarnations of compensating have been utilized but it has not been explicitly revealed. Learning with compensating is called compensation learning and a systematic taxonomy is constructed for it in this study. In our taxonomy, compensation learning is divided on the basis of the compensation targets, directions, inference manners, and granularity levels. Many existing learning algorithms including some classical ones can be viewed or understood at least partially as compensation techniques. Furthermore, a family of new learning algorithms can be obtained by plugging the compensation learning into existing learning algorithms. Specifically, two concrete new learning algorithms are proposed for robust machine learning. Extensive experiments on image classification and text sentiment analysis verify the effectiveness of the two new algorithms. Compensation learning can also be used in other various learning scenarios, such as imbalance learning, clustering, regression, and so on."}
