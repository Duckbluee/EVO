{"abstract":"Abstract. Purpose To recognize and address various sources of bias essential for algorithmic fairness and trustworthiness and to contribute to a just and equitable deployment of AI in medical imaging, there is an increasing interest in developing medical imaging-based machine learning methods, also known as medical imaging artificial intelligence (AI), for the detection, diagnosis, prognosis, and risk assessment of disease with the goal of clinical implementation. These tools are intended to help improve traditional human decision-making in medical imaging. However, biases introduced in the steps toward clinical deployment may impede their intended function, potentially exacerbating inequities. Specifically, medical imaging AI can propagate or amplify biases introduced in the many steps from model inception to deployment, resulting in a systematic difference in the treatment of different groups. Approach Our multi-institutional team included medical physicists, medical imaging artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) researchers, experts in AI/ML bias, statisticians, physicians, and scientists from regulatory bodies. We identified sources of bias in AI/ML, mitigation strategies for these biases, and developed recommendations for best practices in medical imaging AI/ML development. Results Five main steps along the roadmap of medical imaging AI/ML were identified: (1) data collection, (2) data preparation and annotation, (3) model development, (4) model evaluation, and (5) model deployment. Within these steps, or bias categories, we identified 29 sources of potential bias, many of which can impact multiple steps, as well as mitigation strategies. Conclusions Our findings provide a valuable resource to researchers, clinicians, and the public at large."}
