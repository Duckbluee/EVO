{"abstract":"Genetic Algorithm: GA (Genetic Algorithm) is the oldest of all Evolutionary algorithms and it is called as the parent of the evolution algorithms. GA has been gradually introduced as powerful tools to handle complex, multi-nodal optimization problems. Like nature does do its living things, GAS tends to evolve a group of initial poorly generated solutions to a set of acceptable solutions through successive generations. The major advantage of GAS lies in their computational simplicity, and their powerful search ability to attain the global optimum. Genetic algorithm is a multiple point probabilistic search technique and is characterized by the mechanism of natural selection and natural genetics. Genetic algorithm consists of three basic operators, namely, reproduction, cross over and mutation."}
