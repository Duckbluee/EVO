{"abstract":"Image-text matching tasks\nhave recently attracted a lot of attention in the computer vision field. The\nkey point of this cross-domain problem is how to accurately measure the\nsimilarity between the visual and the textual contents, which demands a fine\nunderstanding of both modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel position\nfocused attention network (PFAN) to investigate the relation between the visual\nand the textual views. In this work, we integrate the object position clue to\nenhance the visual-text joint-embedding learning. We first split the images into blocks, by which we\ninfer the relative position of region in the image. Then, an attention\nmechanism is proposed to model the relations between the image region and\nblocks and generate the valuable position feature, which will be further\nutilized to enhance the region expression and model a more reliable\nrelationship between the visual image and the textual sentence. Experiments\non the popular datasets Flickr30K and MS-COCO show the effectiveness of the\nproposed method. Besides the public datasets, we also conduct experiments on\nour collected practical news dataset (Tencent-News) to validate the practical\napplication value of proposed method. As far as we know, this is the first\nattempt to test the performance on the practical application. Our method can achieve\nthe state-of-art performance on all of these three datasets."}
