{"abstract":"Recently 3D scene understanding attracts attention for many applications, however, annotating a vast amount of 3D data for training is usually expensive and time consuming. To alleviate the needs of ground truth, we propose a self-supervised schema to learn 4D spatio-temporal features (i.e. 3 spatial dimensions plus 1 temporal dimension) from dynamic point cloud data by predicting the temporal order of sampled and shuffled point cloud clips. 3D sequential point cloud contains precious geometric and depth information to better recognize activities in 3D space compared to videos. To learn the 4D spatio-temporal features, we introduce 4D convolution neural networks to predict the temporal order on a self-created large scale dataset, NTU-PCLs, derived from the NTU-RGB+D dataset. The efficacy of the learned 4D spatio-temporal features is verified on two tasks: 1) Self-supervised 3D nearest neighbor retrieval; and 2) Self-supervised representation learning transferred for action recognition on a smaller 3D dataset. Our extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed self-supervised learning method which achieves comparable results w.r.t. the fully-supervised methods on action recognition on MSRAction3D dataset."}
