{"abstract":"Advances in Geographic Information Science (GISc) and the increasing availability of location data have facilitated the dissemination of crime data and the abundance of crime mapping websites. However, data holders acknowledge that when releasing sensitive crime data there is a risk of compromising the victims' privacy. Hence, protection methodologies are primarily applied to the data to ensure that individual privacy is not violated. This article addresses one group of location protection methodologies, namely geographical masks that are applicable for crime data representations. The purpose is to identify which mask is the most appropriate for crime incident visualizations. A global divergence index (GDi) and a local divergence index (LDi) are developed to compare the effects that these masks have on the original crime point pattern. The indices calculate how dissimilar the spatial information of the masked data is from the spatial information of the original data in regards to the information obtained via spatial crime analysis. The results of the analysis show that the variable radius mask and the donut geomask should be primarily used for crime representations as they produce less spatial information divergence of the original crime point pattern than the alternative local random rotation mask and circular mask."}
