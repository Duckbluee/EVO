{"abstract":"Face recognition (FR) has made extraordinary progress owing to the advancement of deep convolutional neural networks. However, demographic bias among different racial cohorts still challenges the practical face recognition system. The race factor has been proven to be a dilemma for fair FR (FFR) as the subject-related specific attributes induce the classification bias whilst carrying some useful cues for FR. To mitigate racial bias and meantime preserve robust FR, we abstract face identity-related representation as a signal denoising problem and propose a progressive cross transformer (PCT) method for fair face recognition. Originating from the signal decomposition theory, we attempt to decouple face representation into i) identity-related components and ii) noisy/identity-unrelated components induced by race. As an extension of signal subspace decomposition, we formulate face decoupling as a generalized functional expression model to cross-predict face identity and race information. The face expression model is further concretized by designing dual cross-transformers to distill identity-related components and suppress racial noises. In order to refine face representation, we take a progressive face decoupling way to learn identity/race-specific transformations, so that identity-unrelated components induced by race could be better disentangled. We evaluate the proposed PCT on the public fair face recognition benchmarks (BFW, RFW) and verify that PCT is capable of mitigating bias in face recognition while achieving state-of-the-art FR performance. Besides, visualization results also show that the attention maps in PCT can well reveal the race-related/biased facial regions."}
