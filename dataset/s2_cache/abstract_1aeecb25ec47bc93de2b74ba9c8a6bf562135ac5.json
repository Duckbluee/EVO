{"abstract":"Mobile traffic classification and prediction are key tasks for network optimization. Most of the works in this area present two main drawbacks. First, they treat the two tasks separately, thus requiring high computational capabilities. Second, they perform data mining on the information collected from the data plane, which is unsuitable for the mobile edge. To bridge this gap, this paper properly tailors a Multi-Task Learning model running directly at the edge of the network to anticipate information on the type of traffic to be served and the resource allocation pattern requested by each service during its execution. Our study exploits data mining from the control channel of an operative mobile network to also reduce storage and monitoring processing. Different configurations of neural networks, which adopt autoencoders (i.e. Undercomplete Autoencoder or Sequence to Sequence Autoencoder) as key building blocks of the proposed Multi-Task Learning methodology for common feature representations, are investigated to evaluate the impact of the observation window of traffic profiles on the classification accuracy, prediction loss, complexity, and convergence. The comparison with respect to conventional single-task learning approaches, that do not use autoencoders and tackle classification and prediction tasks separately, clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed Multi-Task Learning approach under different system configurations."}
