{"abstract":"The recent advancement of leadership class supercomputers was enabled by Frontier, the world’s first Exascale supercomputer, leveraging AMD EPYCTM CPU and AMD InstinctTM GPU accelerators. Meeting the compute density and efficiency targets was beyond traditional Moore’s Law silicon scaling; accordingly, innovations in the AMD CDNATM architecture and design as well as packaging and platform architectures were required. AMD utilized an advanced packaging architecture known as Elevated Fanout Bridge (EFB) to fabricate the accelerator engine with integrated High Bandwidth Memory (HBM). EFB has proven to be a cost-effective and reliable packaging technology with the ability to meet the current performance requirements for HBM2e and to scale for future architectures."}
