{"abstract":"With the widespread application of vehicle GPS equipment, more and more trajectory data are becoming available. Traditional research on trajectory-based route planning uses trajectory data to build a weighted graph, and then obtains routes using classic graph theory-based search algorithms, which has difficulty in estimating multiple preferences. The Recurrent Graph Network (RGN) [1] is a graph neural network, which solves the shortest path problem as a classification problem, i.e., given arbitrary (source, destination) pair, classifying whether the nodes and edges in the graph should be labeled as \"on the shortest path connecting the source and destination\". Since the RGN model has non-linear feature representation ability and multiple feature fusion ability, this paper considers modifying it for the trajectory-based route planning. However, the actual trajectory data is highly sparse and non-uniform distributed, so that learning trajectory routing in large road networks is a few-shot learning task. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper proposes the Long Short-Term Memory Graph Network (LSTM-GN) model. The LSTM-GN utilizes a deep LSTM-style message passing process to update various features including comprehensive node-level features, edge-level features and graph-level features, achieving trajectory routing patterns representation based on fewer samples. Additionally, the LSTM-GN needs to get over the difficulty of severe class imbalance and high computational complexity. This paper addresses the above challenges from two perspectives. Firstly, this paper proposes the subgraph filtering algorithms to narrow learning space. Secondly, this paper designs a dynamic weighted loss function to strengthen the positive class. This paper conducts experiments on the real-world trajectory dataset, and the main evaluation metric F1-score of LSTM-GN exceeds the RGN model by 19.18%."}
