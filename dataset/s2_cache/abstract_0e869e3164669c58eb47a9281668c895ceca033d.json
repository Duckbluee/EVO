{"abstract":"Light-based adversarial attacks use spatial augmented reality (SAR) techniques to fool image classifiers by altering the physical light condition with a controllable light source, e.g., a projector. Compared with physical attacks that place hand-crafted adversarial objects, projector-based ones obviate modifying the physical entities, and can be performed transiently and dynamically by altering the projection pattern. However, subtle light perturbations are insufficient to fool image classifiers, due to the complex environment and project-and-capture process. Thus, existing approaches focus on projecting clearly perceptible adversarial patterns, while the more interesting yet challenging goal, stealthy projector-based attack, remains open. In this paper, for the first time, we formulate this problem as an end-to-end differentiable process and propose a Stealthy Projector-based Adversarial Attack (SPAA) solution. In SPAA, we approximate the real Project-and-Capture process using a deep neural network named PCNet, then we include PCNet in the optimization of projector-based attacks such that the generated adversarial projection is physically plausible. Finally, to generate both robust and stealthy adversarial projections, we propose an algorithm that uses minimum perturbation and adversarial confidence thresholds to alternate between the adversarial loss and stealthiness loss optimization. Our experimental evaluations show that SPAA clearly outperforms other methods by achieving higher attack success rates and meanwhile being stealthier, for both targeted and untargeted attacks."}
