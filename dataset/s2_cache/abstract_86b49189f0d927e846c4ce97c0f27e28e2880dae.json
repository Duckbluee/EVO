{"abstract":"Graph data have become increasingly important, and graph node clustering has emerged as a fundamental task in data analysis. In recent years, graph node clustering has gradually moved from traditional shallow methods to deep neural networks due to the powerful representation capabilities of deep learning. In this article, we review some representatives of the latest graph node clustering methods, which are classified into three categories depending on their principles. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world graph datasets to evaluate the performance of these methods. Four mainstream evaluation performance metrics are used, including clustering accuracy, normalized mutual information, adjusted rand index, and F1-score. Based on the experimental results, several potential research challenges and directions in the field of deep graph node clustering are pointed out. This work is expected to facilitate researchers interested in this field to provide some insights and further promote the development of deep graph node clustering."}
