{"abstract":"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are de facto node classification models in graph structured data. However, during testing-time, these algorithms assume no data shift, i.e., $\\Pr_\\text{train}(X,Y) = \\Pr_\\text{test}(X,Y)$. Domain adaption methods can be adopted for data shift, yet most of them are designed to only encourage similar feature distribution between source and target data. Conditional shift on classes can still affect such adaption. Fortunately, graph yields graph homophily across different data distributions. In response, we propose Shift-Robust Node Classification (SRNC) to address these limitations. We introduce an unsupervised cluster GNN on target graph to group the similar nodes by graph homophily. An adversarial loss with label information on source graph is used upon clustering objective. Then a shift-robust classifier is optimized on training graph and adversarial samples on target graph, which are generated by cluster GNN. We conduct experiments on both open-set shift and representation-shift, which demonstrates the superior accuracy of SRNC on generalizing to test graph with data shift. SRNC is consistently better than previous SoTA domain adaption algorithm on graph that progressively use model predictions on target graph for training."}
