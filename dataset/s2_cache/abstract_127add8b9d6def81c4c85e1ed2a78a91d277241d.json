{"abstract":"Abstract Sets out the properties of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), the form calculated by computers. (i) Definition and fundamental properties: exact forms of inverse transform, Parseval's theorem, circular convolution and correlation theorems; symmetry properties. (ii) Approximation of integral transforms: sampling and aliasing in 1-D; minimum reciprocal width property. (iii) Multidimensional forms: generalization of 1-D theorems; sampling in 2-D with Cartesian and oblique axes (commensurate with crystal unit cells)."}
