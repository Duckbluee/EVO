{"abstract":"The tracking of moving targets has important research significance and practical benefit in the field of drone tracking. In this paper, the target tracking we focus on is the general single-target tracking. The target is calibrated with a rectangle only in the first frame, and the target is tracked in the subsequent frame based on the information of the previous frame. Firstly, we introduce some traditional algorithms for visual tracking and analyze the advantages and disadvantages. Secondly, the tracking algorithms based on correlation filter are analyzed. Thirdly, we raise expectations and prospects for future target tracking based UAV."}
