{"abstract":"Many mechanisms within biological systems can be modeled as pathways, chains of interactions between proteins, genes, chemicals, and other biological entities. These interactions can be represented using a graph structure, more specifically a knowledge graph representing known or inferred information about the entities in question. In this context, we propose a constraint propagation approach for identifying paths in a graph structure which represent potential biological pathways. We apply this approach to a knowledge graph dataset which was semantically extracted from literature on COVID-19."}
