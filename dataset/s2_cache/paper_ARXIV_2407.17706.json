Similar to classic machine-learning models, VQCs can be trained through various optimization approaches, such as gradient-based or gradient-free methods. However, when employing gradient-based methods, the gradient variance of VQCs may dramatically vanish as the number of qubits or layers increases. This issue, a.k.a. barren plateaus (BPs), seriously hinders the scaling of VQCs on large datasets. To mitigate the barren plateaus, extensive efforts have been devoted to tackling this issue through diverse strategies. In this survey, we conduct a systematic literature review of recent works from both investigation and mitigation perspectives. Furthermore, we propose a new taxonomy to categorize most existing mitigation strategies into five groups and introduce them in detail. Also, we compare the concurrent survey papers about BPs. Finally, we provide insightful discussion on future directions for BPs."}
