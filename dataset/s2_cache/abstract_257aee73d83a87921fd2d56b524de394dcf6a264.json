{"abstract":"Significance We demonstrate that a neural network automatically solves, explains, and generates university-level problems from the largest Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) mathematics courses at a human level. Our methods combine three innovations: 1) using recent neural networks pretrained on text and fine-tuned on code rather than pretrained on text; 2) few-shot learning synthesizing programs that correctly solve course problems automatically; and 3) a pipeline to solve questions, explain solutions, and generate new questions indistinguishable by students from course questions. Our work solves university-level mathematics courses and improves upon state-of-the-art, increasing automatic accuracy on randomly sampled questions on a benchmark by order of magnitude. Implications for higher education include roles of artificial intelligence (AI) in automated course evaluation and content generation."}
