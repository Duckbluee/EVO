{"abstract":"In machine learning, exploring data correlations to predict outcomes is a fundamental task. Recognizing causal relationships embedded within data is pivotal for a comprehensive understanding of system dynamics, the significance of which is paramount in data‐driven decision‐making processes. Beyond traditional methods, there has been a shift toward using graph neural networks (GNNs) for causal learning, given their capabilities as universal data approximators. Thus, a thorough review of the advancements in causal learning using GNNs is both relevant and timely. To structure this review, we introduce a novel taxonomy that encompasses various state‐of‐the‐art GNN methods used in studying causality. GNNs are further categorized based on their applications in the causality domain. We further provide an exhaustive compilation of datasets integral to causal learning with GNNs to serve as a resource for practical study. This review also touches upon the application of causal learning across diverse sectors. We conclude the review with insights into potential challenges and promising avenues for future exploration in this rapidly evolving field of machine learning."}
