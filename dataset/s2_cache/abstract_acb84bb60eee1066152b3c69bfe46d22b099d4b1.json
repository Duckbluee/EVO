{"abstract":"Data sharing within patients, hospitals and medical centers and the diversity of healthcare data still remain one of the main challenges in Albania. Exchanging health information is crucial because it can improve treatment, health care and decision-making process. FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is used as a standard for exchanging healthcare information in HL7 (Health Level 7). FHIR is based on the RESTful principles, so the resources can be accessed using HTTP and displayed in XML or JSON format. The aim of this paper is to analyse the use of FHIR standard in improving interoperability and integration of patient?s data between different hospital services and radiology service in Albania."}
