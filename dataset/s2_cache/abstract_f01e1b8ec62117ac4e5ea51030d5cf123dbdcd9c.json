{"abstract":"This work presents an approach for incrementally updating deep neural network (DNN) models in a non-stationary environment. DNN models are sensitive to changes in input data distribution, which limits their application to problem settings with stationary input datasets. In a non-stationary environment, updating a DNN model requires parameter re-training or model ﬁne-tuning. We propose an unsupervised source-free method to update DNN classiﬁcation models. The contributions of this work are two-fold. First, we use trainable Gaussian prototypes to generate representative samples for future iterations; second, using unsupervised domain adaptation, we incrementally adapt the existing model using unlabelled data. Unlike existing methods, our approach can update a DNN model incrementally for non-stationary source and target tasks without storing past training data. We evaluated our work on incremental sentiment prediction and incremental disease prediction applications and compared our approach to state-of-the-art continual learning, domain adaptation, and ensemble learning methods. Our results show that our approach achieved improved performance compared to existing incremental learning methods. We observe minimal forgetting of past knowledge over many iterations, which can help us develop unsupervised self-learning systems."}
