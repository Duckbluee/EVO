{"abstract":"In this paper, we study the problem of learning continuous vector representations of knowledge graphs for predicting missing links. We present a new approach called ConEx, which infers missing links by leveraging the composition of a 2D convolution with a Hermitian inner product of complex-valued embedding vectors. We evaluate ConEx against state-of-the-art approaches on the WN18RR, FB15K-237, KINSHIP and UMLS benchmark datasets. Our experimental results show that ConEx achieves a performance superior to that of state-of-the-art approaches such as RotatE, QuatE and TuckER on the link prediction task on all datasets while requiring at least 8 times fewer parameters. We ensure the reproducibility of our results by providing an open-source implementation which includes the training, evaluation scripts along with pre-trained models at this https URL."}
