{"abstract":"Current storytelling systems focus more ongenerating stories with coherent plots regard-less of the narration style, which is impor-tant for controllable text generation. There-fore, we propose a new task, stylized story gen-eration, namely generating stories with speci-fied style given a leading context. To tacklethe problem, we propose a novel generationmodel that first plans the stylized keywordsand then generates the whole story with theguidance of the keywords. Besides, we pro-pose two automatic metrics to evaluate theconsistency between the generated story andthe specified style. Experiments demonstratesthat our model can controllably generateemo-tion-driven orevent-driven stories based onthe ROCStories dataset (Mostafazadeh et al.,2016). Our study presents insights for stylizedstory generation in further research."}
