{"abstract":"Open-source repositories provide wealth of information and are increasingly being used to build artificial intelligence (AI) based systems to solve problems in software engineering. Open-source repositories could be of varying quality levels, and bad-quality repositories could degrade performance of these systems. Evaluating quality of open-source repositories, which is not available directly on code hosting sites such as GitHub, is thus important. In this hackathon, we utilize known code quality measures and GrimoireLab toolkit to implement a framework, named Gi tRank, to rank open-source repositories on three different criteria. We discuss our findings and preliminary evaluation in this hackathon report."}
