{"abstract":"Driven by the vision of “intelligent connection of everything” toward 6G, the collective intelligence of networked machines can be fully exploited to improve system efficiency by shifting the paradigm of wireless communication design from naive maximalist approaches to intelligent value-based approaches. In this article, we propose an on-purpose machine communication framework enabled by joint communication, sensing and computation (JCSC) technology, which employs machine semantics as the interactive information flow. Naturally, there are potential technical barriers to be solved before the wide-spread adoption of on-purpose communications, including the conception of machine purpose, fast and concise networking strategy, and semantics-aware information exchange mechanism during the process of task-oriented cooperation. Hence, we discuss enabling technologies complemented by a range of open challenges. Simulation result shows that the proposed framework can significantly reduce networking overhead and improve communication efficiency."}
