{"abstract":"Recently, the knowledge graph (KG) of sci-tech and big data technology has played a paramount role in the development of the science of science. We carry out a systematic and in-depth review of KG construction and big data technology application in the sci-tech field. Specifically, we explain the issues of sci-tech entity extraction, sci-tech entity disambiguation, sci-tech relationship extraction, and sci-tech relationship inference involved in the construction of sci-tech big data KG, and give a systematized summary of the analysis and mining methods of the sci-tech big data KG, such as sci-tech entity recommendation, sci-tech community detection, sci-tech entity evaluation, interdisciplinary research, and disciplinary evolution analysis. Lastly, we give the future research and application directions of the sci-tech KG."}
