{"abstract":"Audio codec models are widely used in audio communication as a crucial technique for compressing audio into discrete representations. Nowadays, audio codec models are increasingly utilized in generation fields as intermediate representations. For instance, AudioLM is an audio generation model that uses the discrete representation of SoundStream as a training target, while VALL-E employs the Encodec model as an intermediate feature to aid TTS tasks. Despite their usefulness, two challenges persist: (1) training these audio codec models can be difficult due to the lack of publicly available training processes and the need for large-scale data and GPUs; (2) achieving good reconstruction performance requires many codebooks, which increases the burden on generation models. In this study, we propose a group-residual vector quantization (GRVQ) technique and use it to develop a novel \\textbf{Hi}gh \\textbf{Fi}delity Audio Codec model, HiFi-Codec, which only requires 4 codebooks. We train all the models using publicly available TTS data such as LibriTTS, VCTK, AISHELL, and more, with a total duration of over 1000 hours, using 8 GPUs. Our experimental results show that HiFi-Codec outperforms Encodec in terms of reconstruction performance despite requiring only 4 codebooks. To facilitate research in audio codec and generation, we introduce AcademiCodec, the first open-source audio codec toolkit that offers training codes and pre-trained models for Encodec, SoundStream, and HiFi-Codec.
