{"abstract":"Pedestrian trajectory prediction is an extremely challenging problem because of the crowdedness and clutter of the scenes. Previous deep learning LSTM-based approaches focus on the neighbourhood influence of pedestrians but ignore the scene layouts in pedestrian trajectory prediction. In this paper, a novel hierarchical LSTM-based network is proposed to consider both the influence of social neighbourhood and scene layouts. Our SS-LSTM, which stands for Social-Scene-LSTM, uses three different LSTMs to capture person, social and scene scale information. We also use a circular shape neighbourhood setting instead of the traditional rectangular shape neighbourhood in the social scale. We evaluate our proposed method against two baseline methods and a state-of-art technique on three public datasets. The results show that our method outperforms other methods and that using circular shape neighbourhood improves the prediction accuracy."}
