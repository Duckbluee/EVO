{"abstract":"Although artificial intelligence technologies have provided valuable insights into the advertising industry, more comprehensive studies that properly examine the applications of AI in advertising using scientometric network analysis are needed. Using publications from journals indexed in the Web of Science, we seek to analyze the emergence of AI through the examination of keyword co-occurrences and co-authorship. Our goal is to identify essential concepts and influential research that have significantly impacted the advertising business. The findings highlight noteworthy patterns, indicating the growing importance of machine learning tools and techniques such as deep learning, and advanced natural language processing methods like word2vec, GANs, and others, as well as their societal impacts as they continue to define the future of advertising practices."}
