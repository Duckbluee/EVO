{"abstract":"Deep neural networks model data for a task or a sequence of tasks, where the knowledge extracted from the data is encoded in the parameters and representations of the network. Extraction and utilization of these representations is vital when data is no longer available in the future, especially in a continual learning scenario. We introduce flashcards, which are visual representations that capture the encoded knowledge of a network as a recursive function of some predefined random image patterns. In a continual learning scenario, flashcards help to prevent catastrophic forgetting by consolidating the knowledge of all the previous tasks. Flashcards are required to be constructed only before learning the subsequent task, hence, they are independent of the number of tasks trained before, making them task agnostic. We demonstrate the efficacy of flashcards in capturing learned knowledge representation (as an alternative to the original data), and empirically validate on a variety of continual learning tasks: reconstruction, denoising, and task-incremental classification, using several heterogeneous (varying background and complexity) benchmark datasets. Experimental evidence indicates that: (i) flashcards as a replay strategy is task agnostic, (ii) performs better than generative replay, and (iii) is on par with episodic replay without additional memory overhead."}
