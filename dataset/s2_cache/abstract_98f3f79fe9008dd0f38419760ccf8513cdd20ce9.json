{"abstract":"While both cost-sensitive learning and online learning have been studied separately, these two issues have seldom been addressed simultaneously. Yet, there are many applications where both aspects are important. This paper investigates a class of algorithmic approaches suitable for online cost-sensitive learning, designed for such problems. The basic idea is to leverage existing methods for online ensemble algorithms, and combine these with batch mode methods for cost-sensitive bagging/boosting algorithms. Within this framework, we describe several theoretically sound online cost-sensitive bagging and online cost-sensitive boosting algorithms, and show that the convergence of the proposed algorithms is guaranteed under certain conditions. We then present extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets to compare the performance of the various proposed approaches."}
