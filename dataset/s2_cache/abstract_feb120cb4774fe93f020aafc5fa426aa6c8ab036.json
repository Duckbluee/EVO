{"abstract":"ABSTRACT Medical information systems have been increasingly facilitating and improving the quality of health monitoring, disease-trend modelling and early intervention with evidence-based medical treatment by data mining and feature extraction. Such systems are part of the enterprise information system of the healthcare organisations. We proposed a new algorithm fb-kNN towards recommendation algorithms based on analysis of the patterns of diseases with patterns in human body, which was then implemented in Healthcare 4.0 for the recommendation of diagnosis and treatment. Our developed tool is a complete package solution for the Enterprise Management System (ERP) which shows improvement in healthcare, reducing chronic diseases and mortality rates."}
