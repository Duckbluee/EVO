{"abstract":"Urban computing is an emerging area of investigation in which researchers study cities using digital data. Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) generate one specific type of digital data that offers unprecedented geographic and temporal resolutions. We discuss fundamental concepts of urban computing leveraging LBSN data and present a survey of recent urban computing studies that make use of LBSN data. We also point out the opportunities and challenges that those studies open."}
