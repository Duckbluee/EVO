{"abstract":"This paper presents a framework of mobile robot system for human-aware robot navigation. Recently, we have experienced advanced researches and developments on mobile service robots for cleaning and guide in public places. Autonomous robot navigation in dynamic environments where a robot is surrounded by a lot of pedestrians is one of the major challenges in intelligentrobot systems. In this study, we develop a fuzzy controller to realize a multi objective task planning in crowds. Furthermore, we show an experimental example and discuss the applicabilityof the proposed method from the experimental results."}
