{"abstract":"Low dose computed tomography (LDCT) has attracted more and more attention in routine clinical diagnosis assessment, therapy planning, etc., which can reduce the dose of X-ray radiation to patients. However, the noise caused by low X-ray exposure degrades the CT image quality and then affects clinical diagnosis accuracy. In this paper, we train a transformer-based neural network to enhance the final CT image quality. To be specific, we first decompose the noisy LDCT image into two parts: high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) compositions. Then, we extract content features (X_{L_c}) and latent texture features (X_{L_t}) from the LF part, as well as HF embeddings (X_{H_f}) from the HF part. Further, we feed X_{L_t} and X_{H_f} into a modified transformer with three encoders and decoders to obtain well-refined HF texture features. After that, we combine these well-refined HF texture features with the pre-extracted X_{L_c} to encourage the restoration of high-quality LDCT images with the assistance of piecewise reconstruction. Extensive experiments on Mayo LDCT dataset show that our method produces superior results and outperforms other methods."}
