{"abstract":"Recognition of microseismic events is the primary task of microseismic monitoring. Aiming at the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of weak microseismic events and the high cost of labeling them, an unsupervised learning method for recognizing microseismic events is proposed. The method first recognizes microseismic events from monitoring data segments by simultaneous deep clustering and then performs a second clustering to further pick the first arrival times of the detected microseismic events by multistage deep clustering. The networks in this two-step clustering framework are built on a newly designed residual shrinkage dense block (RSDB). To better suppress the noise in microseismic data, RSDB adds a densely connected hybrid dilated convolution and an improved threshold module to the deep residual shrinkage network. The autoencoder built by the RSDB and U-Net architecture is combined with simultaneous deep clustering and multistage deep clustering to recognize microseismic events and their first arrival times, respectively. Finally, tests on the synthetic data and field microseismic data demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method."}
