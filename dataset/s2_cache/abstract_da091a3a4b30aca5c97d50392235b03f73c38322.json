{"abstract":"Endoscopic polyp segmentation plays a fundamental role in the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. However, polyp segmentation often suffers from limited accuracy due to its large variations in appearance, blurry boundary and severe imbalanced illumination. In this paper, we propose a novel Translation Assisted Segmentation Network (TASNet) for polyp segmentation of single-modality endoscopic images. It consists of two branches, i.e. an image-to-image translation branch and an image segmentation branch. These two branches communicate via a shared encoder. For the image-to-image translation branch, a Color Reversal Strategy is established to treat the original image as source image and synthesize target images. Moreover, we introduce a Random Color Reversal Synthesis module for progressive segmentation. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves superior performance than state-of-the-art methods on five widely-used endoscopic image datasets."}
