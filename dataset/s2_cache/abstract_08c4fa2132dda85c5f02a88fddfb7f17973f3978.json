{"abstract":"Abnormal event detection in the surveillance video is an essential\nbut challenging task, and many methods have been\nproposed to deal with this problem. The previous methods\neither only consider the appearance information or directly\nintegrate the results of appearance and motion information\nwithout considering their endogenous consistency\nsemantics explicitly. Inspired by the rule humans identify\nthe abnormal frames from multi-modality signals, we propose\nan Appearance-Motion Memory Consistency Network\n(AMMC-Net). Our method first makes full use of the prior\nknowledge of appearance and motion signals to explicitly\ncapture the correspondence between them in the high-level\nfeature space. Then, it combines the multi-view features to\nobtain a more essential and robust feature representation of\nregular events, which can significantly increase the gap between\nan abnormal and a regular event. In the anomaly detection\nphase, we further introduce a commit error in the latent\nspace joint with the prediction error in pixel space to enhance\nthe detection accuracy. Solid experimental results on various\nstandard datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach."}
