{"abstract":"In this paper we are interested in what we term the federated private bandits framework, that combines differential privacy with multi-agent bandit learning. We explore how differential privacy based Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) methods can be applied to multi-agent environments, and in particular to federated learning environments both in ‘master-worker’ and ‘fully decentralized’ settings. We provide theoretical analysis on the privacy and regret performance of the proposed methods and explore the tradeoffs between these two."}
