{"abstract":"Transportation systems operate in a domain that is anything but simple. Many exhibit both spatial and temporal characteristics, at varying scales, under varying conditions brought on by external sources such as social events, holidays, and the weather. Yet, modeling the interplay of factors, devising generalized representations, and subsequently using them to solve a particular problem can be a challenging task. These situations represent only a fraction of the difficulties faced by modern intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In this paper, we present a survey that highlights the role modeling techniques within the realm of deep learning have played within ITS. We focus on how practitioners have formulated problems to address these various challenges, and outline both architectural and problem-specific considerations used to develop solutions. We hope this survey can help to serve as a bridge between the machine learning and transportation communities, shedding light on new domains and considerations in the future."}
