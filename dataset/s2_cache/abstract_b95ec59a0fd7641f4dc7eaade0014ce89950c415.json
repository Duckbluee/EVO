{"abstract":"Network embedding (NE) approaches have emerged as a predominant technique to represent complex networks and have benefited numerous tasks. However, most NE approaches rely on a homophily assumption to learn embeddings with the guidance of supervisory signals, leaving the unsupervised heterophilous scenario relatively unexplored. This problem becomes especially relevant in fields where a scarcity of labels exists. Here, we formulate the unsupervised NE task as an r-ego network discrimination problem and develop the SELENE framework for learning on networks with homophily and heterophily. Specifically, we design a dual-channel feature embedding pipeline to discriminate r-ego networks using node attributes and structural information separately. We employ heterophily adapted self-supervised learning objective functions to optimise the framework to learn intrinsic node embeddings. We show that SELENE's components improve the quality of node embeddings, facilitating the discrimination of connected heterophilous nodes. Comprehensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets with varying homophily ratios validate the effectiveness of SELENE in homophilous and heterophilous settings showing an up to 12.52% clustering accuracy gain."}
