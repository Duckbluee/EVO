{"abstract":"Information hiding is a subject of study from past to present. Information hiding processes, called steganography, have been the focus of interest since the beginning of history because they are strategically interested in valuable information. In our study, the applications of Steganography with different fields from basic and primitive applications to today's technological applications have been studied. Image Steganography, Video Steganography, Audible Steganography, Text Steganography, Protocol Steganography were examined. Steganography techniques were examined under two headings. Protocol Steganography and Discrete Fourier Transform Technique, Discrete Cosine Transform Technique and Discrete Wavelet Transform Technique are examined. Spatial Domain Methods and Least Important Bits, Optimal Pixel Adjustment Procedure, Pixel Value Difference, Edge Based Data Embedding Method were examined."}
