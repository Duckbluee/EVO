{"abstract":"Incomplete multiview clustering (IMC) is a hot and emerging topic. It is well known that unavoidable data incompleteness greatly weakens the effective information of multiview data. To date, existing IMC methods usually bypass unavailable views according to prior missing information, which is considered a second-best scheme based on evasion. Other methods that attempt to recover missing information are mostly applicable to specific two-view datasets. To handle these problems, in this article, we propose an information-recovery-driven-deep IMC network, termed as RecFormer. Concretely, a two-stage autoencoder network with self-attention structure is built to synchronously extract high-level semantic representations of multiple views and recover the missing data. Besides, we develop a recurrent graph reconstruction mechanism that cleverly leverages the restored views to promote representation learning and further data reconstruction. Visualization of recovery results are given and sufficient experimental results confirm that our RecFormer has obvious advantages over other top methods."}
