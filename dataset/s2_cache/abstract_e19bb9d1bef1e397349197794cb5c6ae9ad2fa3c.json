{"abstract":"The collection of log messages regarding the operation of deployed services and application is an integral component to the forensic analysis for the identification and understanding of security incidents. Approaches for parsing and abstraction of such logs, despite widespread use and study, do not directly account for the individualities of the domain of information security. This, in return, limits their applicability on the field. In this work, we analyze the state-of-the-art log parsing and abstraction algorithms from the perspective of information security. First, we reproduce/replicate previous analysis of such algorithms from the literature. Then, we evaluate their ability for parsing and abstraction of log files for forensic analysis purposes. Our study demonstrates that while the state-of-the-art techniques are accurate in log parsing, improvements are necessary in terms of achieving a holistic view to aid in forensic analysis for the identification and understanding of security incidents."}
