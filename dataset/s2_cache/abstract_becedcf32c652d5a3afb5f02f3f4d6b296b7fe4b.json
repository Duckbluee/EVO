{"abstract":"Recent technological evolution enables Artificial Intelligence (AI) model training by users’ mobile devices, which accelerates decentralized big data analysis. In particular, Federated Learning (FL) is a key enabler to realize decentralized AI model update without user’s privacy disclosure. However, since the behaviour of workers, who are assigned a training task, cannot be monitored, the state-of-the-art methods require a special hardware and/or cryptography to force the workers behave honestly, which hinders the realization. Furthermore, although blockchain-enabled FL has been proposed to give workers reward, any rigorous reward policy design has not been discussed. In this paper, to tackle these issues, we present a novel method using mechanism design, which is an economic approach to realize desired objectives under the situation that participants act rationally. The key idea is to introduce repeated competition for FL so that any rational worker follows the protocol and maximize their profits. With mechanism design, we propose a generic full-fledged protocol design for FL on a public blockchain. We also theoretically clarify incentive compatibility based on contest theory which is an auction-based game theory in economics."}
