{"abstract":"Incomplete multi-view clustering optimally integrates a group of pre-specified incomplete views to improve clustering performance. Among various excellent solutions, multiple kernel $k$k-means with incomplete kernels forms a benchmark, which redefines the incomplete multi-view clustering as a joint optimization problem where the imputation and clustering are alternatively performed until convergence. However, the comparatively intensive computational and storage complexities preclude it from practical applications. To address these issues, we propose Late Fusion Incomplete Multi-view Clustering (LF-IMVC) which effectively and efficiently integrates the incomplete clustering matrices generated by incomplete views. Specifically, our algorithm jointly learns a consensus clustering matrix, imputes each incomplete base matrix, and optimizes the corresponding permutation matrices. We develop a three-step iterative algorithm to solve the resultant optimization problem with linear computational complexity and theoretically prove its convergence. Further, we conduct comprehensive experiments to study the proposed LF-IMVC in terms of clustering accuracy, running time, advantages of late fusion multi-view clustering, evolution of the learned consensus clustering matrix, parameter sensitivity and convergence. As indicated, our algorithm significantly and consistently outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms with much less running time and memory."}
