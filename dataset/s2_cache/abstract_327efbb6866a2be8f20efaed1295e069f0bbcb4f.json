{"abstract":"Agile software development methodology involves developing code incrementally and iteratively from a set of evolving user stories. Since software developers use user stories to write code, these user stories are better representations of the actual code than that of the highlevel product documentation. In this paper, we develop an automated approach using machine learning to generate access control information from a set of user stories that describe the behavior of the software product in question. This is an initial step to automatically produce access control specifications and perform automated security review of a system with minimal human involvement. Our approach takes a set of user stories as input to a transformers-based deep learning model, which classifies if each user story contains access control information. It then identifies the actors, data objects, and operations the user story contains in a named entity recognition task. Finally, it determines the type of access between the identified actors, data objects, and operations through a classification prediction. This information can then be used to construct access control documentation and information useful to stakeholders for assistance during access control engineering, development, and review."}
