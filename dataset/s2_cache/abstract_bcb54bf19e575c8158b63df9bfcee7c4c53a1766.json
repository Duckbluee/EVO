{"abstract":"Trajectory data is essential for various applications. However, publicly available trajectory datasets remain limited in scale due to privacy concerns, which hinders the development of trajectory mining and applications. Although some trajectory generation methods have been proposed to expand dataset scale, they generate trajectories in the geographical coordinate system, posing two limitations for practical applications: 1) failing to ensure that the generated trajectories are road-constrained. 2) lacking road-related information. In this paper, we propose a new problem, road network-constrained trajectory (RNTraj) generation, which can directly generate trajectories on the road network with road-related information. Specifically, RNTraj is a hybrid type of data, in which each point is represented by a discrete road segment and a continuous moving rate. To generate RNTraj, we design a diffusion model called Diff-RNTraj, which can effectively handle the hybrid RNTraj using a continuous diffusion framework by incorporating a pre-training strategy to embed hybrid RNTraj into continuous representations. During the sampling stage, a RNTraj decoder is designed to map the continuous representation generated by the diffusion model back to the hybrid RNTraj format. Furthermore, Diff-RNTraj introduces a novel loss function to enhance trajectory’s spatial validity. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Diff-RNTraj."}
