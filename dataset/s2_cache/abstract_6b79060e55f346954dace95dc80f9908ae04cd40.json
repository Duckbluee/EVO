{"abstract":"This study introduces a robust planning framework that utilizes a model predictive control (MPC) approach, enhanced by incorporating signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. This marks the first-ever study to apply STL-guided trajectory optimization for bipedal locomotion, specifically designed to handle both translational and orientational perturbations. Existing recovery strategies often struggle with reasoning complex task logic and evaluating locomotion robustness systematically, making them susceptible to failures caused by inappropriate recovery strategies or lack of robustness. To address these issues, we design an analytical stability metric for bipedal locomotion and quantify this metric using STL specifications, which guide the generation of recovery trajectories to achieve maximum robustness degree. To enable safe and computational-efficient crossed-leg maneuver, we design data-driven self-leg-collision constraints that are 1000 times faster than the traditional inverse-kinematics-based approach. Our framework outperforms a state-of-the-art locomotion controller, a standard MPC without STL, and a linear-temporal-logic-based planner in a high-fidelity dynamic simulation, especially in scenarios involving crossed-leg maneuvers. In addition, the Cassie bipedal robot achieves robust performance under horizontal and orientational perturbations, such as those observed in ship motions. These environments are validated in simulations and deployed on hardware. Furthermore, our proposed method demonstrates versatility on stepping stones and terrain-agnostic features on inclined terrains."}
