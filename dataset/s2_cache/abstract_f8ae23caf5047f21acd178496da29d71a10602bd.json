{"abstract":"The increasing demand for learning from massive datasets is restructuring our economy. Effective learning, however, involves nontrivial computing resources. Most businesses utilize commercial infrastructure providers (e.g., AWS) to host their computing clusters in the cloud, where various jobs compete for available resources. While cloud resource management is a fruitful research field that has made many advances in production, such as Kubernetes and YARN, few efforts have been invested to further optimize the system performance, especially for Deep Learning (DL) training jobs in a container cluster. This work introduces FlowCon, a system that is able to monitor the individual evaluation functions of DL jobs at runtime, and thus to make placement decisions and resource allocations elastically. We present a detailed design and implementation of FlowCon and conduct intensive experiments over various DL models. The results demonstrate that FlowCon significantly improves DL job completion time and resource utilization efficiency when compared to default systems. According to the results, FlowCon can improve the completion time by up to 68.8% and meanwhile, reduce the makespan by 18.0%, in the presence of various DL job workloads."}
