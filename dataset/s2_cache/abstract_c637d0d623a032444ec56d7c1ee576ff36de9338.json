{"abstract":"Natural language processing (NLP) tools including recently developed large language models (LLMs) have myriad potential applications in medical care and research, including the efficient labeling and classification of unstructured text such as electronic health record (EHR) notes. This opens the door to large‐scale projects that rely on variables that are not typically recorded in a structured form, such as patient signs and symptoms."}
