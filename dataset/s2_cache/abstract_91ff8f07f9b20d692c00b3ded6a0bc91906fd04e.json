{"abstract":"There are growing concerns about the responsible use of content-generating AI systems. Current guidelines for using AI are specific to certain scenarios and not applicable to scientific research. We propose a three-dimensional model consisting of transparency, integrity, and accountability to define responsible AI use in science and introduce “AI Usage Cards” to report the use of AI in scientific research. Our model and reporting system promotes the ethical and responsible use of AI and provides a standardized approach for reporting AI across research fields. We also offer a free service to generate AI Usage Cards via a questionnaire at https://ai-cards.org."}
