{"abstract":"Copy detection, which is a task to determine whether an image is a modified copy of any image in a database, is an unsolved problem. Thus, we addressed copy detection by training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with contrastive learning. Training with a large memory-bank and hard data augmentation enables the CNNs to obtain more discriminative representation. Our proposed negative embedding subtraction further boosts the copy detection accuracy. Using our methods, we achieved 1st place in the Facebook AI Image Similarity Challenge: Descriptor Track.
