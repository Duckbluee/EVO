{"abstract":"This paper addresses the issue of modifying the visual appearance of videos while preserving their motion. A novel framework, named MagicProp, is proposed, which disentangles the video editing process into two stages: appearance editing and motion-aware appearance propagation. In the first stage, MagicProp selects a single frame from the input video and applies image-editing techniques to modify the content and/or style of the frame. The flexibility of these techniques enables the editing of arbitrary regions within the frame. In the second stage, MagicProp employs the edited frame as an appearance reference and generates the remaining frames using an autoregressive rendering approach. To achieve this, a diffusion-based conditional generation model, called PropDPM, is developed, which synthesizes the target frame by conditioning on the reference appearance, the target motion, and its previous appearance. The autoregressive editing approach ensures temporal consistency in the resulting videos. Overall, MagicProp combines the flexibility of image-editing techniques with the superior temporal consistency of autoregressive modeling, enabling flexible editing of object types and aesthetic styles in arbitrary regions of input videos while maintaining good temporal consistency across frames. Extensive experiments in various video editing scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of MagicProp."}
