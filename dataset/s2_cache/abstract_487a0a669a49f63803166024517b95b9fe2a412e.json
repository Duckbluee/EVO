{"abstract":"As part of their learning journey, students frequently encounter challenges and make errors, especially with algorithmic programming questions. Regrettably, providing tailored solutions for these mistakes can impose a significant burden on instructors in terms of time and effort. To address this, automated program repair (APR) techniques have been explored to generate such fixes automatically. Previous research has investigated the use of symbolic and neural approaches for APR in the educational domain. However, both types of approaches necessitate substantial engineering endeavors or extensive data and training. In this study, we propose the utilization of a large language model trained on code to construct an APR system specifically designed for student programs. Our system has the capability to rectify semantic errors by employing a few-shot example generation pipeline solely based on the input code. We assess the performance of our system on one dataset of algorithm implementations, namely QuixBugs. The results demonstrate that the novel example generation pipeline not only enhances the overall system’s performance but also ensures its stability."}
