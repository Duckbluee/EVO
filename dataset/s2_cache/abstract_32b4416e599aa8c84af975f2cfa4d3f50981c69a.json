{"abstract":"Social Internet of Things comes as a new paradigm of Internet of Things to solve the problems of network discovery, navigability, and service composition. It aims to socialize the IoT devices and shape the interconnection between them into social interaction just like human beings. In IoT scenarios, a device can offer multiple services and different devices can offer the same services with different parameters and interest factors. The proliferation of offered services led to difficulties during service filtering and customization, this problem is known as services explosion. The selection of a suitable service that fits the requirements of the applications and devices is a challenging task. Several works have addressed service discovery, composition, and selection in IoT. However, these works did not emphasize on the fact that incorporating the users’ social features can increase the efficiency of the recommended services and help us to offer context-aware services. In this article, we present a service recommendation system that takes advantage of the social relationships between devices’ owners, where the recommendation is based on the different relationships between the service requester and service provider. Experimental results show, in the context of IoT, that incorporating the users’ social relationships in service recommendation increases the accuracy and diversity of the offered services."}
