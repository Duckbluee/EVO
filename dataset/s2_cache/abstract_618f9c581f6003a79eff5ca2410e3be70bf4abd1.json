{"abstract":"With the growth of data and intelligent technologies, the healthcare sector opened numerous technology that enabled services for patients, clinicians, and researchers. One major hurdle in achieving state-of-the-art results in health informatics is domain-specific terminologies and their semantic complexities. A knowledge graph crafted from medical concepts, events, and relationships acts as a medical semantic network to extract new links and hidden patterns from health data sources. Current medical knowledge graph construction studies are limited to generic techniques and opportunities and focus less on exploiting real-world data sources in knowledge graph construction. A knowledge graph constructed from Electronic Health Records (EHR) data obtains real-world data from healthcare records. It ensures better results in subsequent tasks like knowledge extraction and inference, knowledge graph completion, and medical knowledge graph applications such as diagnosis predictions, clinical recommendations, and clinical decision support. This review critically analyses existing works on medical knowledge graphs that used EHR data as the data source at (i) representation level, (ii) extraction level (iii) completion level. In this investigation, we found that EHR-based knowledge graph construction involves challenges such as high complexity and dimensionality of data, lack of knowledge fusion, and dynamic update of the knowledge graph. In addition, the study presents possible ways to tackle the challenges identified. Our findings conclude that future research should focus on knowledge graph integration and knowledge graph completion challenges."}
