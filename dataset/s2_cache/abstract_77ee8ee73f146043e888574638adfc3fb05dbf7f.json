{"abstract":"Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have achieved impressive performance on various generation tasks. By modeling the reverse process of gradually diffusing the data distribution into a Gaussian distribution, generating a sample in DDPMs can be regarded as iteratively denoising a randomly sampled Gaussian noise. However, in practice DDPMs often need hundreds even thousands of denoising steps to obtain a high-quality sample from the Gaussian noise, leading to extremely low inference efficiency. In this work, we propose a principled acceleration strategy, referred to as Early-Stopped DDPM (ES-DDPM), for DDPMs. The key idea is to stop the diffusion process early where only the few initial diffusing steps are considered and the reverse denoising process starts from a non-Gaussian distribution. By further adopting a powerful pre-trained generative model, such as GAN and VAE, in ES-DDPM, sampling from the target non-Gaussian distribution can be efficiently achieved by diffusing samples obtained from the pre-trained generative model. In this way, the number of required denoising steps is significantly reduced. In the meantime, the sample quality of ES-DDPM also improves substantially, outperforming both the vanilla DDPM and the adopted pre-trained generative model. On extensive experiments across CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet, LSUN-Bedroom and LSUN-Cat, ES-DDPM obtains promising acceleration effect and performance improvement over representative baseline methods. Moreover, ES-DDPM also demonstrates several attractive properties, including being orthogonal to existing acceleration methods, as well as simultaneously enabling both global semantic and local pixel-level control in image generation."}
