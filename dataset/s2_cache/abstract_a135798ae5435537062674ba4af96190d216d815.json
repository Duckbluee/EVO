{"abstract":"Recent achievements in language models have showcased their extraordinary capabilities in bridging visual information with semantic language understanding. This leads us to a novel question: can language models connect textual semantics with IoT sensory signals to perform recognition tasks, e.g., Human Activity Recognition (HAR)? If so, an intelligent HAR system with human-like cognition can be built, capable of adapting to new environments and unseen categories. This paper explores its feasibility with an innovative approach, IoT-sEnsors-language alignmEnt pre-Training (TENT), which jointly aligns textual embeddings with IoT sensor signals, including camera video, LiDAR, and mmWave. Through the IoT-language contrastive learning, we derive a unified semantic feature space that aligns multi-modal features with language embeddings, so that the IoT data corresponds to specific words that describe the IoT data. To enhance the connection between textual categories and their IoT data, we propose supplementary descriptions and learnable prompts that bring more semantic information into the joint feature space. TENT can not only recognize actions that have been seen but also ``guess'' the unseen action by the closest textual words from the feature space. We demonstrate TENT achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot HAR tasks using different modalities, improving the best vision-language models by over 12%."}
