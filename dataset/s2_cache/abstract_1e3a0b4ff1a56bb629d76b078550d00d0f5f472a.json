{"abstract":"In this paper, an inverse reinforcement learning method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to model driver’s steering behavior. Initially, the vehicle dynamics is represented by a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model which provides a method of approximating Q-function. Then the driver behavior model is described as an optimal control policy with decision-making model which illustrates the driving style. Subsequently, the Q-function is approximated by a quadratic polynomial-in-memberships form and the PSO algorithm is used to obtain the decision-making model from the driving data. And the corresponding optimal control policy is obtained by using the Q-learning policy iteration method. Finally, a numerical simulation is carried to show the effectiveness of the proposed method."}
