{"abstract":"Significance Humans have long demonstrated an ability to learn from interactions with others. However, artificial intelligence (AI) agents learn in social isolation. To create intelligent systems that understand more than a fixed slice of the world, our article formalizes socially situated AI—a framework that enables agents to interact with people as they simultaneously learn new concepts about the world around them. Using our framework, we deploy a field experiment on a photo-sharing social network where our agent interacts with hundreds of thousands of people to learn concepts about the visual world. We combine advances in deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and human–computer Interaction to deliver a human-centered AI that learns from interactions with people in social environments."}
