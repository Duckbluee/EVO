{"abstract":"Triple-structured open data creates value in many ways. However, the reuse of datasets is still challenging. Users feel difficult to assess the usefulness of a large dataset containing thousands or millions of triples. To satisfy the needs, existing abstractive methods produce a concise high-level abstraction of data. Complementary to that, we adopt the extractive strategy and aim to select the optimum small subset of data from a dataset as a snippet to compactly illustrate the content of the dataset. This has been formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem in our previous work. In this article, we design a new algorithm for the problem, which is an order of magnitude faster than the previous one but has the same approximation ratio. We also develop an anytime algorithm that can generate empirically better solutions using additional time. To suit datasets that are partially accessible via online query services (e.g., SPARQL endpoints for RDF data), we adapt our algorithms to trade off quality of snippet for feasibility and efficiency in the Web environment. We carry out extensive experiments based on real RDF datasets and SPARQL endpoints for evaluating quality and running time. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed algorithms."}
