{"abstract":"To address the problems of large storage requirements, computational pressure, untimely data supply of off-chip memory, and low computational efficiency during hardware deployment due to the large number of convolutional neural network (CNN) parameters, we developed an innovative hardware-friendly CNN pruning method called KRP, which prunes the convolutional kernel on a row scale. A new retraining method based on LR tracking was used to obtain a CNN model with both a high pruning rate and accuracy. Furthermore, we designed a high-performance convolutional computation module on the FPGA platform to help deploy KRP pruning models. The results of comparative experiments on CNNs such as VGG and ResNet showed that KRP has higher accuracy than most pruning methods. At the same time, the KRP method, together with the GSNQ quantization method developed in our previous study, forms a high-precision hardware-friendly network compression framework that can achieve “lossless” CNN compression with a 27× reduction in network model storage. The results of the comparative experiments on the FPGA showed that the KRP pruning method not only requires much less storage space, but also helps to reduce the on-chip hardware resource consumption by more than half and effectively improves the parallelism of the model in FPGAs with a strong hardware-friendly feature. This study provides more ideas for the application of CNNs in the field of edge computing."}
