{"abstract":"Optical side channel attack is a new kind of method against cipher chips, such as singlechips implementing public cryptographic algorithms. Two kind of optical side channel attacks, active and passive attacks, are presented in this paper. First, we implemented optical fault injection attacks against cipher algorithms running on AT89C52 singlechip, and demonstrated how to exploit secret information under attack. Then, we did photonic emission dependency analysis and revealed the correlation between operation/data and the photonic emission from the AT89C52 singlechip at the instruction level. Our experimental results show that optical side channel attacks pose serious threats to Cipher chips.
