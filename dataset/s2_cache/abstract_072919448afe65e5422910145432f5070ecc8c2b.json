{"abstract":"Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a near-term platform for photonic quantum computing. Recent efforts have led to the discovery of GBS algorithms with applications to graph-based problems, point processes, and molecular vibronic spectra in chemistry. The development of dedicated quantum software is a key enabler in permitting users to program devices and implement algorithms. In this work, we introduce a new applications layer for the Strawberry Fields photonic quantum computing library. The applications layer provides users with the necessary tools to design and implement algorithms using GBS with only a few lines of code. This paper serves a dual role as an introduction to the software, supported with example code, and also a review of the current state of the art in GBS algorithms."}
