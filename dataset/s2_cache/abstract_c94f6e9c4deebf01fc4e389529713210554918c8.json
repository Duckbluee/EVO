{"abstract":"The prevalence of multi_drug therapies has been increasing in recent years, particularly among the elderly who are suffering from several diseases. However, unexpected Drug_Drug interaction (DDI) can cause adverse reactions or critical toxicity, which puts patients in danger. As the need for multi_drug treatment increases, it's becoming increasingly necessary to discover DDIs. Nevertheless, DDIs detection in an extensive number of drug pairs, both in-vitro and in-vivo, is costly and laborious. Therefore, DDI identification is one of the most concerns in drug-related researches. In this paper, we propose GNN-DDI, a deep learning-based method for predicting DDI-associated events in two stages. In the first stage, we collect the drugs information from different sources and then integrate them through the formation of an attributed heterogeneous network and generate a drug embedding vector based on different drug interaction types and drug attributes. In the second stage, we aggregate the representation vectors then predictions of the DDIs and their events are performed through a deep multi-model framework. Various evaluation results show that the proposed method can outperform state-of-the methods in the prediction of drug-drug interaction-associated events. The experimental results indicate that producing the drug's representations based on different drug interaction types and attributes is efficient and effective and can better show the intrinsic characteristics of a drug."}
