{"abstract":"Joint entity and relation extraction is an important task in natural language processing, which aims to extract all relational triples mentioned in a given sentence. In essence, the relational triples mentioned in a sentence are in the form of a set, which has no intrinsic order between elements and exhibits the permutation invariant feature. However, previous seq2seq-based models require sorting the set of relational triples into a sequence beforehand with some heuristic global rules, which destroys the natural set structure. In order to break this bottleneck, we treat joint entity and relation extraction as a direct set prediction problem, so that the extraction model is not burdened with predicting the order of multiple triples. To solve this set prediction problem, we propose networks featured by transformers with non-autoregressive parallel decoding. In contrast to autoregressive approaches that generate triples one by one in a specific order, the proposed networks are able to directly output the final set of relational triples in one shot. Furthermore, we also design a set-based loss that forces unique predictions through bipartite matching. Compared with cross-entropy loss that highly penalizes small shifts in triple order, the proposed bipartite matching loss is invariant to any permutation of predictions; thus, it can provide the proposed networks with a more accurate training signal by ignoring triple order and focusing on relation types and entities. Various experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SoTA) models. Training code and trained models are now publicly available at https://github.com/DianboWork/SPN4RE."}
