{"abstract":"Zero-shot NL2SQL is crucial in achieving natural language to SQL that is adaptive to new environments (e.g., new databases, new linguistic phenomena or SQL structures) with zero annotated NL2SQL samples from such environments. Existing approaches either fine-tune pre-trained language models (PLMs) based on annotated data or use prompts to guide fixed large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. PLMs can perform well in schema alignment but struggle to achieve complex reasoning, while LLMs is superior in complex reasoning tasks but cannot achieve precise schema alignment. In this paper, we propose a ZeroNL2SQL framework that combines the complementary advantages of PLMs and LLMs for supporting zero-shot NL2SQL. ZeroNL2SQL first uses PLMs to generate an SQL sketch via schema alignment, then uses LLMs to fill the missing information via complex reasoning. Moreover, in order to better align the generated SQL queries with values in the given database instances, we design a predicate calibration method to guide the LLM in completing the SQL sketches based on the database instances and select the optimal SQL query via an execution-based strategy. Comprehensive experiments show that ZeroNL2SQL can achieve the best zero-shot NL2SQL performance on real-world benchmarks. Specifically, ZeroNL2SQL outperforms the state-of-the-art PLM-based methods by 3.2% to 13% and exceeds LLM-based methods by 10% to 20% on execution accuracy."}
