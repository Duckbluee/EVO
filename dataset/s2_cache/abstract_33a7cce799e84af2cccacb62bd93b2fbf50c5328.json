{"abstract":"Recently, the ever-increasing development of distributed energy resources has created new opportunities for active distribution networks. In particular, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy management systems facilitate the coordination of prosumers for higher efficiency and flexibility. However, in distributed P2P energy management problems, Byzantine attacks may exist and lead to nonconvergence and infeasible solutions, and the computation performance needs to be further improved. Therefore, a Byzantine-resilient distributed P2P energy management approach is developed to minimize the overall cost of prosumers, considering various constraints such as output bounds, power line congestion, and voltage magnitude limits. The proposed distributed optimization method adopts heavy-ball momentum to improve convergence performance. The convergence and optimality of the proposed distributed optimization method are rigorously proven. The effectiveness, superiority, and scalability of the proposed approach are verified in case studies with various types of Byzantine attacks."}
