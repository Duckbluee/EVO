{"abstract":"Predicting biomedical outcomes from Magnetoencephalography and Electroencephalography (M/EEG) is central to applications like decoding, brain-computer-interfaces (BCI) or biomarker development and is facilitated by supervised machine learning. Yet most of the literature is concerned with within-subject classification. Here, we focus on predicting continuous outcomes from M/EEG signal power across subjects. Considering different generative mechanisms for M/EEG signals and the biomedical outcome, we propose statistically-consistent predictive models that avoid source-reconstruction based on the covariance as representation. Our mathematical analysis and ground truth simulations demonstrated that consistent parameter estimation can be obtained with Source Power Comodulation (SPoC) supervised spatial filtering or by embedding with Riemannian geometry. Additional simulations revealed that Riemannian methods were more robust to model violations, in particular geometric distortions induced by individual anatomy. To estimate the relative contribution of brain dynamics and anatomy to prediction performance, we propose a novel model inspection procedure based on biophysical forward modeling. Applied to cross-subject prediction, the analysis revealed that the Riemannian model better exploited anatomical information while sensitivity to brain dynamics was similar across methods. We then probed the robustness of the models across different data cleaning options. Environmental denoising was globally important but Riemannian models were strikingly robust and continued performing even without preprocessing. Our results suggest each method has its niche: SPoC is practical for within-subject prediction while the Riemannian model may enable simple end-to-end learning."}
