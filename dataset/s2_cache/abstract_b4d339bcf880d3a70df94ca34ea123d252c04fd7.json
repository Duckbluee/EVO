{"abstract":"In the field of sequential recommendation, deep learning--(DL) based methods have received a lot of attention in the past few years and surpassed traditional models such as Markov chain-based and factorization-based ones. However, there is little systematic study on DL-based methods, especially regarding how to design an effective DL model for sequential recommendation. In this view, this survey focuses on DL-based sequential recommender systems by taking the aforementioned issues into consideration. Specifically, we illustrate the concept of sequential recommendation, propose a categorization of existing algorithms in terms of three types of behavioral sequences, summarize the key factors affecting the performance of DL-based models, and conduct corresponding evaluations to showcase and demonstrate the effects of these factors. We conclude this survey by systematically outlining future directions and challenges in this field."}
