{"abstract":"The recent work known as Segment Anything (SA) has made significant strides in pushing the boundaries of semantic segmentation into the era of foundation models. The impact of SA has sparked extremely active discussions and ushered in an encouraging new wave of developing foundation models for the diverse tasks in the Euclidean domain, such as object detection and image inpainting. Despite the promising advances led by SA, the concept has yet to be extended to the non-Euclidean graph domain. In this paper, we explore a novel Segment Non-Euclidean Anything (SNA) paradigm that strives to develop foundation models that can handle the diverse range of graph data within the non-Euclidean domain, seeking to expand the scope of SA and lay the groundwork for future research in this direction. To achieve this goal, we begin by discussing the recent achievements in foundation models associated with SA. We then shed light on the unique challenges that arise when applying the SA concept to graph analysis, which involves understanding the differences between the Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains from both the data and task perspectives. Motivated by these observations, we present several preliminary solutions to tackle the challenges of SNA and detail their corresponding limitations, along with several potential directions to pave the way for future SNA research. Experiments on five Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets across various tasks, including graph property classification and regression, as well as multi-label prediction, demonstrate that the performance of the naive SNA solutions has considerable room for improvement, pointing towards a promising avenue for future exploration of Graph General Intelligence."}
