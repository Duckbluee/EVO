{"abstract":"Recently dynamic social networks witnessed a massive surge in popularity, especially in the area of anomaly detection. Although the text-based methods have achieved impressive detection performances, their applications are limited to the social text provided by users. This research focuses on graph-based methods and proposes a universal method for generalized social networks. Different from the existing graph-based methods that summarize a number of structural features, the proposed nodes' evolution diversity inspired method (NEDM) detects anomalies in dynamic social networks from the perspective of diverse evolution mechanisms. More specifically, NEDM applies link prediction algorithms at the micro-level to fit evolution mechanisms followed by the behaviors of nodes, and designs indices to evaluate their fitting degrees in edge removal and generation processes. In addition, the behavior of a node is represented as a quantum superposition state where such behavior follows different evolution mechanisms with uncertain probabilities. We propose a quantum mechanism based particle swarm optimization algorithm (QMPSO) in NEDM. QMPSO determines the optimal observation states of the behaviors of different nodes, and maximally reflects the evolutional fluctuations in the evolution processes of social networks. As a result, NEDM can quantify the evolutional fluctuations in different periods, and detect anomalies in dynamic social networks. Comparing with art-of-the-state methods and real social data in extensive experiments on disparate real-world social networks, we verify the outstanding performance of NEDM in terms of both accuracy and universality."}
