{"abstract":"Remarkable performance from Transformer networks in Natural Language Processing promote the development of these models in dealing with computer vision tasks such as image recognition and segmentation. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, called Multi-level Multi-scale Point Transformer (MLMSPT) that works directly on the irregular point clouds for representation learning. Speciﬁcally, a point pyramid transformer is investi-gated to model features with diverse resolutions or scales we deﬁned, followed by a multi-level transformer module to aggregate contextual information from different levels of each scale and enhance their interactions. While a multi-scale transformer module is designed to capture the dependencies among representations across different scales. Extensive evaluation on public benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the competitive performance of our methods on 3D shape classiﬁcation, segmentation tasks."}
