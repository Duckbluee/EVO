{"abstract":"Integrating LiDAR and Camera information into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) has become an essential topic for 3D object detection in autonomous driving. Existing methods mostly adopt an independent dual-branch framework to generate LiDAR and camera BEV, then perform an adaptive modality fusion. Since point clouds provide more accurate localization and geometry information, they could serve as a reliable spatial prior to acquiring relevant semantic information from the images. Therefore, we design a LiDAR-Guided View Transformer (LGVT) to effectively obtain the camera representation in BEV space and thus benefit the whole dual-branch fusion system. LGVT takes camera BEV as the primitive semantic query, repeatedly leveraging the spatial cue of LiDAR BEV for extracting image features across multiple camera views. Moreover, we extend our framework into the temporal domain with our proposed Temporal Deformable Alignment (TDA) module, which aims to aggregate BEV features from multiple historical frames. Including these two modules, our framework dubbed BEVFusion4D achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D object detection, with 72.0% mAP and 73.5% NDS on the nuScenes validation set, and 73.3% mAP and 74.7% NDS on nuScenes test set, respectively."}
