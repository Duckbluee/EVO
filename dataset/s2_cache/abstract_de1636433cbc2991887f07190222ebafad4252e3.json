{"abstract":"As one category of important incomplete multi-view clustering methods, subspace based methods seek the common latent representation of incomplete multi-view data by matrix factorization and then partition the latent representation to get clustering results. However, these methods ignore missing views in the process of matrix factorization, which makes the connection of different views be exploited inadequately. This paper proposes Incomplete Multi-view Clustering with Reconstructed Views (IMCRV), which utilizes the incomplete examples sufficiently. In IMCRV, the missing views of incomplete examples are reconstructed and the reconstructed views are also used to seek the common latent representation. IMCRV also involves the Laplacian regularization to preserve the global property of the latent representation. The gradient descent method with the multiplicative update rule is employed to solve the objective function of IMCRV. The corresponding iterative algorithm is developed and the convergence of the algorithm is proved. IMCRV is compared with many state-of-the-art incomplete multi-view clustering methods under different Incomplete Example Rates (IER) on public multi-view datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness of IMCRV."}
