In this paper, we aim to summarize the up-to-date development of recent OSR methods, considering their rapid development in recent two or three years. Specifically, we firstly introduce a new taxonomy, under which we comprehensively review the existing DNN-based OSR methods. Then, we compare the performances of some typical and state-of-the-art OSR methods on both coarse-grained datasets and fine-grained datasets under both standard-dataset setting and cross-dataset setting, and further give the analysis of the comparison. Finally, we discuss some open issues and possible future directions in this community."}
