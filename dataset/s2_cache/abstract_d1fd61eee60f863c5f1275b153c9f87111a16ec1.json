{"abstract":"In today's digital world, we are equipped with modern computer-based data collection sources and feature extraction methods. It enhances the availability of the multi-view data and corresponding researches. Multi-view prediction models form a mainstream research direction in the healthcare and bioinformatics domain. While these models are designed with the assumption that there is no missing data for any views, in the real world, certain views of the data are often not having the same number of samples, resulting in the incomplete multi-view dataset. The studies performed over these datasets are termed incomplete multi-view clustering or prediction. Here, we develop a two-stage generative incomplete multi-view prediction model named GIMPP to address the missing view problem of breast cancer prognosis prediction by explicitly generating the missing data. The first stage incorporates the multi-view encoder networks and the bi-modal attention scheme to learn common latent space representations by leveraging complementary knowledge between different views. The second stage generates missing view data using view-specific generative adversarial networks conditioned on the shared representations and encoded features given by other views. Experimental results on TCGA-BRCA and METABRIC datasets proves the usefulness of the developed method over the state-of-the-art methods."}
