{"abstract":"In this paper, we describe a strategy for integrated task and motion planning based on performing a symbolic search for a sequence of high-level operations, such as pick, move and place, while postponing geometric decisions. Partial plans (skeletons) in this search thus pose a geometric constraint-satisfaction problem (CSP), involving sequences of placements and paths for the robot, and grasps and locations of objects. We propose a formulation for these problems in a discretized configuration space for the robot. The resulting problems can be solved using existing methods for discrete CSP."}
