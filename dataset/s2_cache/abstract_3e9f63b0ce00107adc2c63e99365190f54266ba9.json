{"abstract":"The paper considers the problem of the analysis of patents’ figures for formalization of subjective opinions of the patent office experts that reviews applications for inventions. Drawings omission may indicate an incomplete description of the invention and entail the rejection of patent applications and other problems. Since patent images, even if one considers images of the same type, class, etc., are unique, different from each other. Nowadays for image processing are applied neural networks with different architectures. Neural network, Convolutional neural network, Siamese neural network were considered in the research. 4 libraries (Theano, TensorFlow, Caffe, and Keras) were studied. The main contributions of the paper are the new classification of patents’ imaged, training dataset formation and quality improvement approach, and the software implementation for CNN training."}
