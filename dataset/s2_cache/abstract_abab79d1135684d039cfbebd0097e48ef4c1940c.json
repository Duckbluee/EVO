{"abstract":"Text-to-image generation has attracted significant interest from researchers and practitioners in recent years due to its widespread and diverse applications across various industries. Despite the progress made in the domain of vision and language research, the existing literature remains relatively limited, particularly with regard to advancements and applications in this field. This paper explores a relevant research track within multimodal applications, including text, vision, audio, and others. In addition to the studies discussed in this paper, we are also committed to continually updating the latest relevant papers, datasets, application projects and corresponding information at https://github.com/Yutong-Zhou-cv/Awesome-Text-to-Image."}
