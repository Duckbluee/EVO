{"abstract":"Knowledge graphs’ reasoning is of great significance for the further development of artificial intelligence and information retrieval, especially for reasoning over temporal knowledge graphs. The rotation-based method has been shown to be effective at modeling entities and relations on a knowledge graph. However, due to the lack of temporal information representation capability, existing approaches can only model partial relational patterns and they cannot handle temporal combination reasoning. In this regard, we propose HTTR: Householder Transformation-based Temporal knowledge graph Reasoning, which focuses on the characteristics of relations that evolve over time. HTTR first fuses the relation and temporal information in the knowledge graph, then uses the Householder transformation to obtain an orthogonal matrix about the fused information, and finally defines the orthogonal matrix as the rotation of the head-entity to the tail-entity and calculates the similarity between the rotated vector and the vector representation of the tail entity. In addition, we compare three methods for fusing relational and temporal information. We allow other fusion methods to replace the current one as long as the dimensionality satisfies the requirements. We show that HTTR is able to outperform state-of-the-art methods in temporal knowledge graph reasoning tasks and has the ability to learn and infer all of the four relational patterns over time: symmetric reasoning, antisymmetric reasoning, inversion reasoning, and temporal combination reasoning."}
