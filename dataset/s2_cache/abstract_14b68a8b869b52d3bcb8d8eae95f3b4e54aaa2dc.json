{"abstract":"Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) is a challenging problem that aims to learn VAD models only with video-level annotations. In this work, we propose a Long-Short Temporal Co-teaching (LSTC) method to address the WS-VAD problem. It constructs two tubelet-based spatio-temporal transformer networks to learn from short- and long-term video clips respectively. Each network is trained with respect to a multiple instance learning (MIL)-based ranking loss, together with a cross-entropy loss when clip-level pseudo labels are available. A co-teaching strategy is adopted to train the two networks. That is, clip-level pseudo labels generated from each network are used to supervise the other one at the next training round, and the two networks are learned alternatively and iteratively. Our proposed method is able to better deal with the anomalies with varying durations as well as subtle anomalies. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art WS-VAD methods. Code is available at https://github.com/shengyangsun/LSTC_VAD."}
