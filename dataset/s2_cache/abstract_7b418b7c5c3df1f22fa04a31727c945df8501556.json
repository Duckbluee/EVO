{"abstract":"The increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has led to growing concerns about their safety, security risks, and ethical implications. This paper aims to provide an overview of the different types of security risks associated with ChatGPT, including malicious text and code generation, private data disclosure, fraudulent services, information gathering, and producing unethical content. We present an empirical study examining the effectiveness of ChatGPT's content filters and explore potential ways to bypass these safeguards, demonstrating the ethical implications and security risks that persist in LLMs even when protections are in place. Based on a qualitative analysis of the security implications, we discuss potential strategies to mitigate these risks and inform researchers, policymakers, and industry professionals about the complex security challenges posed by LLMs like ChatGPT. This study contributes to the ongoing discussion on the ethical and security implications of LLMs, underscoring the need for continued research in this area."}
