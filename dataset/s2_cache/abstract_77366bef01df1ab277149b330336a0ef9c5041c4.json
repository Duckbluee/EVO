{"abstract":"Absorption Index (AI) remains valid for old-aged unsealed transformers as a simple and effective method of non-destructive control insulation. The reasons for AI decrease within transformer operation are insulation moistening and contamination. Seven gradation levels of the insulation condition and algorithm of the operating procedures are proposed depending on the value of the measured AI and its variation in time. Along with AI, it is recommended to measure the polarisation index (PI) and the PI-2 (R 600 /R 15 ratio)."}
