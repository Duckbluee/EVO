{"abstract":"Highlights • We develop transformers for unsupervised brain imaging anomaly detection.• Our approach combines a VQ-VAE with an ensemble of autoregressive transformers.• Transformers outperform variational autoencoders across diverse classes of anomaly.• Models are trained on UK Biobank MRI data, in 2D and 3D implementations.• Evaluation includes white matter hyperintensities, tumours, and multiple sclerosis lesions."}
