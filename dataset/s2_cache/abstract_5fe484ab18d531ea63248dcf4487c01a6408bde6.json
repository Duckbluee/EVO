{"abstract":"This paper describes an open-access database focusing on the study of mental workload (MW) assessment system for wearable devices. A wristband photoplethysmogram (PPG) was provided as a representative of wearable devices. In addition, a clinical device that can record Electrocardiography (ECG) , galvanic skin response (GSR) and, fingertip PPG was included in the database as a reference. The MW was induced by performing the N-back task with 22 subjects. The participants were asked to answer the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire at the beginning of the experiment and the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) questionnaire after each N-back task. The result of data analysis show the potential uses of the recorded modalities and the feasibility of the MW elicitation protocol. Finally the MAUS dataset is now available for academic use (The MAUS dataset is available at IEEE Dataport: https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/maus-dataset-mental-workload-assessment-n-back-task-using-wearable-sensor). Besides, we also presents a reproducible baseline system as a preliminary benchmark (The code of the baseline system on MAUS dataset is available on Github: https://github.com/rickwu11/MAUS\\_dataset\\_baseline\\_system), which testing accuracy are 71.6 %, 66.7 %, and 59.9 % in ECG, fingertip PPG, wristband PPG, respectively."}
