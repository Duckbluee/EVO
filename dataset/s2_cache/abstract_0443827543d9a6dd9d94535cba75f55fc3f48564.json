{"abstract":"The destitution of image data and corresponding expert annotations limit the training capacities of AI diagnostic models and potentially inhibit their performance. To address such a problem of data and label scarcity, generative models have been developed to augment the training datasets. Previously proposed generative models usually require manually adjusted annotations (e.g., segmentation masks) or need pre-labeling. However, studies have found that these pre-labeling based methods can induce hallucinating artifacts, which might mislead the downstream clinical tasks, while manual adjustment could be onerous and subjective. To avoid manual adjustment and pre-labeling, we propose a novel controllable and simultaneous synthesizer (dubbed CS$$"}
