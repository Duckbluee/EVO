{"abstract":"Handling intellectual property involves the cognitive process of understanding the innovation described in the body of patent claims. In this paper we present an on-going project on a multi-level text simplification to assist experts in this complex task. Two levels of simplification procedure are described. The macro-level simplification results in the visualization of the hierarchy of multiple claims. The micro-level simplification includes visualization of the claim terminology, decomposition of the claim complex structure into a set of simple sentences and building a graph explicitly showing the interrelations of the invention elements. The methodology is implemented in an experimental text simplifying computer system. The motivation underlying this research is to develop tools that could increase the overall productivity of human users and machines in processing patent applications."}
