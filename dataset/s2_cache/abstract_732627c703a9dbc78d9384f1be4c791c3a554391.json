{"abstract":"Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP have shown great progress in transfer learning. In the inference stage, the proper text description, also known as prompt, needs to be carefully designed to correctly classify the given images. In order to avoid laborious prompt engineering, recent works such as CoOp, CLIP-Adapter and Tip-Adapter propose to adapt vision-language models for downstream image recognition tasks on a small set of labeled data. Though promising improvements are achieved, requiring labeled data from the target datasets may restrict the scalability. In this paper, we explore a different scenario, in which the labels of the target datasets are unprovided, and we present an unsupervised prompt learning (UPL) approach to avoid prompt engineering while simultaneously improving transfer performance of CLIP-like vision-language models. As far as we know, UPL is the first work to introduce unsupervised learning into prompt learning. Experimentally, our UPL outperforms original CLIP with prompt engineering on ImageNet as well as other 10 datasets. An enhanced version of UPL is even competitive with the 8-shot CoOp and the 8-shot TIP-Adapter on most datasets. Code and models are available at https://github.com/tonyhuang2022/UPL."}
