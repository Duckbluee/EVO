{"abstract":"Offline policy learning aims to discover decision-making policies from previously-collected datasets without additional online interactions with the environment. As the training dataset is fixed, its quality becomes a crucial determining factor in the performance of the learned policy. This paper studies a dataset characteristic that we refer to as multi-behavior, indicating that the dataset is collected using multiple policies that exhibit distinct behaviors. In contrast, a uni-behavior dataset would be collected solely using one policy. We observed that policies learned from a uni-behavior dataset typically outperform those learned from multi-behavior datasets, despite the uni-behavior dataset having fewer examples and less diversity. Therefore, we propose a behavior-aware deep clustering approach that partitions multi-behavior datasets into several uni-behavior subsets, thereby benefiting downstream policy learning. Our approach is flexible and effective; it can adaptively estimate the number of clusters while demonstrating high clustering accuracy, achieving an average Adjusted Rand Index of 0.987 across various continuous control task datasets. Finally, we present improved policy learning examples using dataset clustering and discuss several potential scenarios where our approach might benefit the offline policy learning community."}
