{"abstract":"We investigate the physical layer security (PLS) in multi-user interference networks. In particular, we consider secure transmission from a legitimate source (Alice) to a legitimate destination (Bob), coexisting with multiple passive eavesdroppers (Eves), as well as multiple legitimate transceivers. By assuming that only statistical channel state informations (CSIs) of Eves and local CSIs of legitimate users are available, we propose an artificial noise (AN) assisted interference alignment (IA) for security enhancement. Unlike traditional IA based security approaches which may result in secret signal cancellation, we design a modified alternating minimization (AM) scheme to overcome this threat, by incorporating the max-eigenmode beamforming (MEB) for secure transmission. Moreover, by partitioning the IA equation into three independent subsets and their combinations, a much tighter necessary condition for IA feasibility is established. We also provide guiding insights into the practical system designs, including useful guidelines for the selection of the dimension of AN. Furthermore, the power allocation ratio between the secret signal and the AN signal is optimized to minimize the secrecy outage probability (SOP), subject to a minimum secrecy rate constraint. Numerical results demonstrate that our design can enhance both quality and security of the secret signal, and thus is suitable and reliable for PLS in interference networks."}
