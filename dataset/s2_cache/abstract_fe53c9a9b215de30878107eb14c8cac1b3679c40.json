{"abstract":"Phishing web page is one of the most serious threats to the users of the Internet. Traditional phishing web page detection methods rely on manually designed features. Recently, deep learning-based methods using HTML as input have achieved significant detection performance improvement. They usually treat HTML codes as sequences of characters and utilize Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for classification. However, CNN and RNN typically can only extract local features in the HTML code sequences while failing to model the long-range semantics that is crucial for phishing detection. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) based phishing web page detection method that can effectively utilize the inherent structural information of HTML to capture the long-range semantics. We first naturally represent an HTML as a graph according to its Document Object Model (DOM) and utilize RNN to extract the local features of node attributes. Then we adopt GNN to model the long-range relations between nodes based on these local features and the graph structure. Our proposed model combines the advantage of RNN and GNN to better understand the intention of HTML codes. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the accuracy of our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin."}
