{"abstract":"Recent diffusion-based AI art platforms can create impressive images from simple text descriptions. This makes them powerful tools for concept design in any discipline that requires creativity in visual design tasks. This is also true for early stages of architectural design with multiple stages of ideation, sketching and modelling. In this paper, we investigate how applicable diffusion-based models already are to these tasks. We research the applicability of the platforms Midjourney, DALL·\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$\\cdot$$\\end{document}E 2 and Stable Diffusion to a series of common use cases in architectural design to determine which are already solvable or might soon be. Our novel contributions are: (i) a comparison of the capabilities of public AI art platforms; (ii) a specification of the requirements for AI art platforms in supporting common use cases in civil engineering and architecture; (iii) an analysis of 85 million Midjourney queries with Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to extract common usage patterns. From this we derived (iv) a workflow for creating images for interior designs and (v) a workflow for creating views for exterior design that combines the strengths of the individual platforms."}
