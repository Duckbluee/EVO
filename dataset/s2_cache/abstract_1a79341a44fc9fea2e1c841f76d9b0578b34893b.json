{"abstract":"Deepfakes, malicious visual contents created by generative models, pose an increasingly harmful threat to society. To proactively mitigate deepfake damages, recent studies have employed adversarial perturbation to disrupt deepfake model outputs. However, previous approaches primarily focus on generating distorted outputs based on only predetermined target attributes, leading to a lack of robustness in real-world scenarios where target attributes are unknown. Additionally, the transferability of perturbations between two prominent generative models, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models, remains unexplored. In this paper, we emphasize the importance of target attribute-transferability and model-transferability for achieving robust deepfake disruption. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective disruption method called Latent Ensemble ATtack (LEAT), which attacks the independent latent encoding process. By disrupting the latent encoding process, it generates distorted output images in subsequent generation processes, regardless of the given target attributes. This target attribute-agnostic attack ensures robust disruption even when the target attributes are unknown. Additionally, we introduce a Normalized Gradient Ensemble strategy that effectively aggregates gradients for iterative gradient attacks, enabling simultaneous attacks on various types of deepfake models, involving both GAN-based and Diffusion-based models. Moreover, we demonstrate the insufficiency of evaluating disruption quality solely based on pixel-level differences. As a result, we propose an alternative protocol for comprehensively evaluating the success of defense. Extensive experiments confirm the efficacy of our method in disrupting deepfakes in real-world scenarios, reporting a higher defense success rate compared to previous methods."}
