{"abstract":"Transformers have become the dominant architecture for sequence modeling tasks such as natural language processing or audio processing, and they are now even considered for tasks that are not naturally sequential such as image classification. Their ability to attend to and to process a set of tokens as context enables them to develop in-context few-shot learning abilities. However, their potential for online continual learning remains relatively unexplored. In online continual learning, a model must adapt to a non-stationary stream of data, minimizing the cumulative nextstep prediction loss. We focus on the supervised online continual learning setting, where we learn a predictor $x_t \\rightarrow y_t$ for a sequence of examples $(x_t, y_t)$. Inspired by the in-context learning capabilities of transformers and their connection to meta-learning, we propose a method that leverages these strengths for online continual learning. Our approach explicitly conditions a transformer on recent observations, while at the same time online training it with stochastic gradient descent, following the procedure introduced with Transformer-XL. We incorporate replay to maintain the benefits of multi-epoch training while adhering to the sequential protocol. We hypothesize that this combination enables fast adaptation through in-context learning and sustained longterm improvement via parametric learning. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art results on CLOC, a challenging large-scale real-world benchmark for image geo-localization."}
