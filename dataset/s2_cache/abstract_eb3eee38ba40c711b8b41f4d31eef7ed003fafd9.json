{"abstract":"In the era of big data, the amount of data that individuals and enterprises hold is increasing, and the efficiency and effectiveness of data analysis are increasingly demanding. Collaborative deep learning, as a machine learning framework that can share users' data and improve learning efficiency, has drawn more and more attention and started to be applied in practical problems. In collaborative deep learning, data sharing and interaction among multi users may lead data leakage especially when data are very sensitive to the user. Therefore, how to protect the data privacy when processing collaborative deep learning becomes an important problem. In this paper, we review the current state of art researches in this field and summarize the application of privacy-preserving technologies in two phases of collaborative deep learning. Finally we discuss the future direction and trend on this problem."}
