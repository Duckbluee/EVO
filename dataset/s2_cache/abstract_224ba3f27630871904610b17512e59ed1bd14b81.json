{"abstract":"Purpose Due to various physical degradation factors and limited counts received, PET image quality needs further improvements. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) was a distribution learning-based model, which tried to transform a normal distribution into a specific data distribution based on iterative refinements. In this work, we proposed and evaluated different DDPM-based methods for PET image denoising. Methods Under the DDPM framework, one way to perform PET image denoising was to provide the PET image and/or the prior image as the input. Another way was to supply the prior image as the network input with the PET image included in the refinement steps, which could fit for scenarios of different noise levels. 150 brain [ $$^{18}$$ 18 F]FDG datasets and 140 brain [ $$^{18}$$ 18 F]MK-6240 (imaging neurofibrillary tangles deposition) datasets were utilized to evaluate the proposed DDPM-based methods. Results Quantification showed that the DDPM-based frameworks with PET information included generated better results than the nonlocal mean, Unet and generative adversarial network (GAN)-based denoising methods. Adding additional MR prior in the model helped achieved better performance and further reduced the uncertainty during image denoising. Solely relying on MR prior while ignoring the PET information resulted in large bias. Regional and surface quantification showed that employing MR prior as the network input while embedding PET image as a data-consistency constraint during inference achieved the best performance. Conclusion DDPM-based PET image denoising is a flexible framework, which can efficiently utilize prior information and achieve better performance than the nonlocal mean, Unet and GAN-based denoising methods."}
