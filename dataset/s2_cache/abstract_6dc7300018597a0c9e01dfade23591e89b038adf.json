{"abstract":"We introduce DialogPaint, a novel framework that bridges conversational interactions with image editing, enabling users to modify images through natural dialogue. By integrating a dialogue model with the Stable Diffusion image transformation technique, DialogPaint offers a more intuitive and interactive approach to image modifications. Our method stands out by effectively interpreting and executing both explicit and ambiguous instructions, handling tasks such as object replacement, style transfer, and color modification. Notably, DialogPaint supports iterative, multi-round editing, allowing users to refine image edits over successive interactions. Comprehensive evaluations highlight the robustness and versatility of our approach, marking a significant advancement in dialogue-driven image editing."}
