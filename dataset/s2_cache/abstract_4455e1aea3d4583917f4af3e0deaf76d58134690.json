{"abstract":"The current study aimed to analyse global economic disparities through the lens of international classification systems, such as those of the United Nations, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund (IMF). Countries are grouped into developed, emerging, developing, and least developed economies based on indicators, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, GDP adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), industrialization level, and human development indices. The research highlighted how such classifications reveal structural imbalances in global wealth, production, and living standards. Using 2022–2023 data, the study compared economic performance across major regional and institutional groups including the European Union (EU), the Group of Seven (G7), and fuel-exporting nations to identify key patterns of inequality and growth potential. Findings showed substantial variation in income distribution and productivity, underscoring the importance of targeted policy, investment, and development strategies. These insights contribute to a clearer understanding of how global classifications inform sustainable growth and international cooperation."}
