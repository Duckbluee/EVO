{"abstract":"Semantic communication (SemCom) is expected to be a core paradigm in future communication networks, yielding significant benefits in terms of spectrum resource saving and information interaction efficiency. However, the existing SemCom structure is limited by the lack of context-reasoning ability and background knowledge provisioning, which, therefore, motivates us to seek the potential of incorporating generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technologies with SemCom. Recognizing GAI's powerful capability in automating and creating valuable, diverse, and personalized multimodal content, this article first highlights the principal characteristics of the combination of GAI and SemCom along with their pertinent benefits and challenges. To tackle these challenges, we further propose a novel GAI-integrated SemCom network (GAI-SCN) framework in a cloud-edge-mobile design. Specifically, by employing global and local GAI models, our GAI-SCN enables multimodal semantic content provisioning, semantic-level joint-source-channel coding, and AIGC acquisition to maximize the efficiency and reliability of semantic reasoning and resource utilization. Afterward, we present a detailed implementation workflow of GAI-SCN, followed by corresponding initial simulations for performance evaluation in comparison with two benchmarks. Finally, we discuss several open issues and offer feasible solutions to unlock the full potential of GAI-SCN."}
