{"abstract":"Regularization plays a crucial role in machine learning models, especially for deep neural networks. The existing regularization techniques mainly reply on the i.i.d. assumption and only employ the information of the current sample, without the leverage of neighboring information between samples. In this work, we propose a general regularizer called Patch-level Neighborhood Interpolation~(\\textbf{Pani}) that fully exploits the relationship between samples. Furthermore, by explicitly constructing a patch-level graph in the different network layers and interpolating the neighborhood features to refine the representation of the current sample, our Patch-level Neighborhood Interpolation can then be applied to enhance two popular regularization strategies, namely Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT) and MixUp, yielding their neighborhood versions. The first derived \\textbf{Pani VAT} presents a novel way to construct non-local adversarial smoothness by incorporating patch-level interpolated perturbations. In addition, the \\textbf{Pani MixUp} method extends the original MixUp regularization to the patch level and then can be developed to MixMatch, achieving the state-of-the-art performance. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the Patch-level Neighborhood Interpolation in both supervised and semi-supervised settings."}
