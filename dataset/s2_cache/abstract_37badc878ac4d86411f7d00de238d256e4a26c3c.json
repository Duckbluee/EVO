{"abstract":"Deep architecture have proven capable of solving many tasks provided a sufficient amount of labeled data. In fact, the amount of available labeled data has become the principal bottleneck in low label settings such as Semi-Supervised Learning. Mixing Data Augmentations do not typically yield new labeled samples, as indiscriminately mixing contents creates between-class samples. In this work, we introduce the SciMix framework that can learn to replace the global semantic content from one sample. By teaching a StyleGan generator to embed a semantic style code into image backgrounds, we obtain new mixing scheme for data augmentation. We then demonstrate that SciMix yields novel mixed samples that inherit many characteristics from their non-semantic parents. Afterwards, we verify those samples can be used to improve the performance semi-supervised frameworks like Mean Teacher or Fixmatch, and even fully supervised learning on a small labeled dataset."}
