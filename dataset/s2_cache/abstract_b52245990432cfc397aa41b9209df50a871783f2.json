{"abstract":"In the recent years, the categorization of text documents into predefined classifications has perceived a growing interest due to the growing of documents in digital form and needs to organize them. Text categorization is one of the extensively used for natural language processing (NLP) applications have achieved using machine learning algorithms. Text classification is a challenging researcher to find the best suitable structure and technique. Classification process done using manual and automatic classification. This research paper covers the preprocessing, feature extraction, different algorithms and techniques for text classification and finally evaluates the performance metrics for assessment."}
