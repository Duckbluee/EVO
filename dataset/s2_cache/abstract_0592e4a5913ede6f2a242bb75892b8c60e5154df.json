{"abstract":"With the popularity of online social networks, social recommendations that rely on oneâ€™s social connections to make personalized recommendations have become possible. This introduces vulnerabilities for an adversarial party to compromise the recommendations for users by utilizing their social connections. In this paper, we propose the targeted poisoning attack on the factorization-based social recommender system in which the attacker aims to promote an item to a group of target users by injecting fake ratings and social connections. We formulate the optimal poisoning attack as a bi-level program and develop an efficient algorithm to find the optimal attacking strategy. We then evaluate the proposed attacking strategy on real-world dataset and demonstrate that the social recommender system is sensitive to the targeted poisoning attack. We find that users in the social recommender system can be attacked even if they do not have direct social connections with the attacker."}
