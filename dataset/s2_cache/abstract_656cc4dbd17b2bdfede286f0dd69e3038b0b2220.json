{"abstract":"We present adversarial event prediction (AEP), a novel approach to detecting abnormal events through an event prediction setting. Given normal event samples, AEP derives the prediction model, which can discover the correlation between the present and future of events in the training step. In obtaining the prediction model, we propose adversarial learning for the past and future of events. The proposed adversarial learning enforces AEP to learn the representation for predicting future events and restricts the representation learning for the past of events. By exploiting the proposed adversarial learning, AEP can produce the discriminative model to detect an anomaly of events without complementary information, such as optical flow and explicit abnormal event samples in the training step. We demonstrate the efficiency of AEP for detecting anomalies of events using the UCSD-Ped, CUHK Avenue, Subway, and UCF-Crime data sets. Experiments include the performance analysis depending on hyperparameter settings and the comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the proposed adversarial learning can assist in deriving a better model for normal events on AEP, and AEP trained by the proposed adversarial learning can surpass the existing state-of-the-art methods."}
