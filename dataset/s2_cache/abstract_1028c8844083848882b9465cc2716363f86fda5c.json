{"abstract":"This paper reviews the state of the art and future trends of indoor Positioning, Localization, and Navigation (PLAN). It covers the requirements, the main players, sensors, and techniques for indoor PLAN. Other than the navigation sensors such as Inertial Navigation System (INS) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), the environmental-perception sensors such as High-Definition map (HD map), Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), camera, the fifth generation of mobile network communication technology (5G), and Internet-of-Things (IoT) signals are becoming important aiding sensors for PLAN. The PLAN systems are expected to be more intelligent and robust under the emergence of more advanced sensors, multi-platform/multi-device/multi-sensor information fusion, self-learning systems, and the integration with artificial intelligence, 5G, IoT, and edge/fog computing."}
