{"abstract":"Membership inference attacks seek to infer membership of individual training instances of a model to which an adversary has black-box access through a machine learning-as-a-service API. In providing an in-depth characterization of membership privacy risks against machine learning models, this paper presents a comprehensive study towards demystifying membership inference attacks from two complimentary perspectives. First, we provide a generalized formulation of the development of a black-box membership inference attack model. Second, we characterize the importance of model choice on model vulnerability through a systematic evaluation of a variety of machine learning models and model combinations using multiple datasets. Through formal analysis and empirical evidence from extensive experimentation, we characterize under what conditions a model may be vulnerable to such black-box membership inference attacks. We show that membership inference vulnerability is data-driven and corresponding attack models are largely transferable. Though different model types display different vulnerabilities to membership inference, so do different datasets. Our empirical results additionally show that (1) using the type of target model under attack within the attack model may not increase attack effectiveness and (2) collaborative learning exposes vulnerabilities to membership inference risks when the adversary is a participant. We also discuss countermeasure and mitigation strategies."}
