{"abstract":"— Deep learning based parallel imaging (PI) has made great progresses in recent years to accelerate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Nevertheless, the performances and robustness of existing methods can still be improved. In this work, we propose to explore the k-space domain learning via robust generative modeling for flexible PI reconstruction, coined weight-k-space generative model (WKGM). Specifically, WKGM is a generalized k-space domain model, where the k-space weighting technology and high-dimensional space augmentation design are efficiently incorporated for score-based generative model training, resulting in good and robust reconstructions. In addition, WKGM is flexible and thus can be synergistically combined with various traditional k-space PI models, generating learn-ing-based priors to produce high-fidelity reconstructions. Experimental results on datasets with varying sampling patterns and acceleration factors demonstrate that WKGM can attain state-of-the-art reconstruction results with the well-learned k-space generative prior."}
