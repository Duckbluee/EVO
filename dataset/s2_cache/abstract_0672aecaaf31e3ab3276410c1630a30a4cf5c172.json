{"abstract":"This paper consolidates the core technologies and key concepts of our novel Lachesis consensus protocol and Fantom Opera platform, which is permissionless, leaderless and EVM compatible. We introduce our new protocol, so-called Lachesis, for distributed networks achieving Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT)~\\cite{lachesis01}. Each node in Lachesis protocol operates on a local block DAG, namely \\emph{OPERA DAG}. Aiming for a low time to finality (TTF) for transactions, our general model considers DAG streams of high speed but asynchronous events. We integrate Proof-of-Stake (PoS) into a DAG model in Lachesis protocol to improve performance and security. Our general model of trustless system leverages participants' stake as their validating power~\\cite{stakedag}. Lachesis's consensus algorithm uses Lamport timestamps, graph layering and concurrent common knowledge to guarantee a consistent total ordering of event blocks and transactions. In addition, Lachesis protocol allows dynamic participation of new nodes into Opera network. Lachesis optimizes DAG storage and processing time by splitting local history into checkpoints (so-called epochs). We also propose a model to improve stake decentralization, and network safety and liveness ~\\cite{stairdag}. Built on our novel Lachesis protocol, Fantom's Opera platform is a public, leaderless, asynchronous BFT, layer-1 blockchain, with guaranteed deterministic finality. Hence, Lachesis protocol is suitable for distributed ledgers by leveraging asynchronous partially ordered sets with logical time ordering instead of blockchains. We also present our proofs into a model that can be applied to abstract asynchronous distributed system."}
