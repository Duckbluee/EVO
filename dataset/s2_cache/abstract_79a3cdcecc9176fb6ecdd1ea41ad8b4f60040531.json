{"abstract":"Robots accompanying humans is one of the core capacities every service robot deployed in urban settings should have. We present a novel robot companion approach based on the so-called Social Force Model (SFM). A new model of robot-person interaction is obtained using the SFM which is suited for our robots Tibi and Dabo. Additionally, we propose an interactive scheme for robot's human-awareness navigation using the SFM and prediction information. Moreover, we present a new metric to evaluate the robot companion performance based on vital spaces and comfortableness criteria. Also, a multimodal human feedback is proposed to enhance the behavior of the system. The validation of the model is accomplished throughout an extensive set of simulations and real-life experiments."}
