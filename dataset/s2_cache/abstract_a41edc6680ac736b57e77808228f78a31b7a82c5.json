{"abstract":"Current gait recognition research mainly focuses on identifying pedestrians captured by the same type of sensor, neglecting the fact that individuals may be captured by different sensors in order to adapt to various environments. A more practical approach should involve cross-modality matching across different sensors. Hence, this paper focuses on investigating the problem of cross-modality gait recognition, with the objective of accurately identifying pedestrians across diverse vision sensors. We present CrossGait inspired by the feature alignment strategy, capable of cross retrieving diverse data modalities. Specifically, we investigate the cross-modality recognition task by initially extracting features within each modality and subsequently aligning these features across modalities. To further enhance the cross-modality performance, we propose a Prototypical Modality-shared Attention Module that learns modality-shared features from two modality-specific features. Additionally, we design a Cross-modality Feature Adapter that transforms the learned modality-specific features into a unified feature space. Extensive experiments conducted on the SUSTech1K dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CrossGait: (1) it exhibits promising cross-modality ability in retrieving pedestrians across various modalities from different sensors in diverse scenes, and (2) CrossGait not only learns modality-shared features for cross-modality gait recognition but also maintains modality-specific features for single-modality recognition."}
