{"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel embedding model, named ConvKB, for knowledge base completion. Our model ConvKB advances state-of-the-art models by employing a convolutional neural network, so that it can capture global relationships and transitional characteristics between entities and relations in knowledge bases. In ConvKB, each triple (head entity, relation, tail entity) is represented as a 3-column matrix where each column vector represents a triple element. This 3-column matrix is then fed to a convolution layer where multiple filters are operated on the matrix to generate different feature maps. These feature maps are then concatenated into a single feature vector representing the input triple. The feature vector is multiplied with a weight vector via a dot product to return a score. This score is then used to predict whether the triple is valid or not. Experiments show that ConvKB obtains better link prediction and triple classification results than previous state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets WN18RR, FB15k-237, WN11 and FB13. We further apply our ConvKB to a search personalization problem which aims to tailor the search results to each specific user based on the user’s personal interests and preferences. In particular, we model the potential relationship between the submitted query, the user and the search result (i.e., document) as a triple (query, user, document) on which the ConvKB is able to work. Experimental results on query logs from a commercial web search engine show that ConvKB achieves better performances than the standard ranker as well as strong search personalization baselines."}
