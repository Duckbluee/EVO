{"abstract":"Witha rapid rise of complex data every year needs more enrichment in machine learning methods to provide vigorous and accurate data classification. Deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) have accomplished to obtain better results in the domain of computer vision, object recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing compared to traditional machine learning algorithms. This paper mainly discusses about the blending of attention mechanism with various deep learning models for text classification which improves the performance of text classification task."}
