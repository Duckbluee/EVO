{"abstract":"The Gottesman-Knill theorem says that a stabilizer circuit\\char22{}that is, a quantum circuit consisting solely of controlled-NOT (CNOT), Hadamard, and phase gates\\char22{}can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer. This paper improves that theorem in several directions. First, by removing the need for Gaussian elimination, we make the simulation algorithm much faster at the cost of a factor of 2 increase in the number of bits needed to represent a state. We have implemented the improved algorithm in a freely available program called CHP (CNOT-Hadamard-phase), which can handle thousands of qubits easily. Second, we show that the problem of simulating stabilizer circuits is complete for the classical complexity class $\\ensuremath{\\bigoplus}\\mathsf{L}$, which means that stabilizer circuits are probably not even universal for classical computation. Third, we give efficient algorithms for computing the inner product between two stabilizer states, putting any $n$-qubit stabilizer circuit into a ``canonical form'' that requires at most $O({n}^{2}∕\\mathrm{log}\\phantom{\\rule{0.2em}{0ex}}n)$ gates, and other useful tasks. Fourth, we extend our simulation algorithm to circuits acting on mixed states, circuits containing a limited number of nonstabilizer gates, and circuits acting on general tensor-product initial states but containing only a limited number of measurements."}
