{"abstract":"Rapid advancement in machine learning is increasing the demand for effective graph data analysis. However, real-world graph data often exhibits class imbalance, leading to poor performance of standard machine learning models on underrepresented classes. To address this, Class-Imbalanced Learning on Graphs (CILG) has emerged as a promising solution that combines graph representation learning and class-imbalanced learning. This survey provides a comprehensive understanding of CILG’s current state-of-the-art, establishing the first systematic taxonomy of existing work and its connections to traditional imbalanced learning. We critically analyze recent advances and discuss key open problems. A continuously updated reading list of relevant articles and code implementations is available at https://github.com/yihongma/CILG-Papers."}
