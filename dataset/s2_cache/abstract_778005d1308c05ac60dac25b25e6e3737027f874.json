{"abstract":"This brief investigates the resilient consensus control for multiagent systems over a time-varying directed random network. We propose a median-based consensus strategy, which is purely distributed and, as opposed to the Weighted-Mean-Subsequence-Reduced approaches in the existing literature, shared estimate regarding the number of malicious agents in the neighborhood of each cooperative agent is not required. This offers more applicability and flexibility as seeking a shared estimate of surrounding threats is often difficult in practice. In addition to malicious agents, random availability of communication edges is accommodated in the random network framework. Sufficient conditions are derived for reaching almost sure consensus by using a martingale convergence theorem. Finally, the theoretical findings are illustrated by numerical simulations."}
