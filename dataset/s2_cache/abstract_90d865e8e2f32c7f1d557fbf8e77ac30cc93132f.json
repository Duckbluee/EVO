{"abstract":"Volumetric video (or hologram video), the medium for representing natural content in VR/AR/MR, is presumably the next generation of video technology and a typical use case for 5G and beyond wireless communications. To realize volumetric video applications, efficient volumetric video streaming is in critical demand. This article responds to the challenges of and proposes solutions to wireless transmission systems of point cloud video, which is the most popular and favored way to represent volumetric media and significantly differs from the other types of videos. In particular, we first introduce point cloud video technology and its applications, and then discuss the challenges of and solutions to point cloud video streaming, including encoding, tiling, viewing angle prediction, decoding, quality assessment and transmission optimization. Furthermore, we explain a prototype of a MPEG DASH-based point cloud video streaming system as a preliminary study, along with more simulation results to verify its performance. Finally, we identify future research directions for providing high-quality point cloud video streaming."}
