{"abstract":"Four and a half years after PyTorch 1.0, we announced PyTorch 2.0 at the PyTorch Conference last December. The message was simple – introducing compiled mode, torch.compile(), to the core of PyTorch. This talk shares our 5-year journey of finding the right compiler solutions for PyTorch. We answer questions like: (i) Why did it take so long? (ii) What was the biggest challenge of designing compiler solutions for PyTorch? (iii) How did we co-design the compiler w/ the core of PyTorch? (iiii) What conventions did we break in the design of TorchDynamo and TorchInductor? As an ML compiler, PyTorch 2.0 is unconventional in many ways. By sharing our thought processes, insights, and design decisions during the development of PT2, we hope to bring new thinking into the thriving landscape of ML compilers and inject a dose of real-world considerations into the research community."}
