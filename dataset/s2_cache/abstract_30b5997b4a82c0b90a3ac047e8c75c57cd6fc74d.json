{"abstract":"In this paper, we present ALLECS, a lightweight web application to serve grammatical error correction (GEC) systems so that they can be easily used by the general public. We design ALLECS to be accessible to as many users as possible, including users who have a slow Internet connection and who use mobile phones as their main devices to connect to the Internet. ALLECS provides three state-of-the-art base GEC systems using two approaches (sequence-to-sequence generation and sequence tagging), as well as two state-of-the-art GEC system combination methods using two approaches (edit-based and text-based). ALLECS can be accessed at https://sterling8.d2.comp.nus.edu.sg/gec-demo/"}
