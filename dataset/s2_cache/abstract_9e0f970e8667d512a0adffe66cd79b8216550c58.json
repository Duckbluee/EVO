{"abstract":"Correlation filter trackers building on deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) contribute efficient visual object trackers but remain challenged with severe target appearance variations. The reason for this is that CNNs trained for image classification tasks are less discriminative to the dynamic variations of targets and backgrounds. In this paper, we propose an adaptive discriminative deep correlation filter (adaDDCF), which, by incorporating discriminative feature fine-tuning with adaptive appearance modeling, pursues stable object tracking in complex backgrounds. In adaDDCF, a convolutional Fisher discriminative analysis (FDA) layer is implemented for positive and negative instance mining and scene-specific feature learning. A correlation layer is then embedded to learn the correlation response of consecutive frames for target appearance modeling. With an online learning procedure using forward–backward propagation, the FDA layer and the correlation layer are effectively coupled, leading to effective and discriminative fine-tuning for the proposed tracker, which consequently alleviates the target drifting problem. Extensive experiments on the challenging benchmarks OTB2013, OTB2015, and OTB50 demonstrate that the proposed adaDDCF tracker outperforms many state-of-the-art trackers."}
