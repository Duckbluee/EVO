{"abstract":"Memory reactivations and replay, widely reported in the hippocampus and cortex across species, have been implicated in memory consolidation, planning, and spatial and skill learning. Technology advances in electrophysiology, calcium imaging and human neuroimaging techniques have enabled us to measure large-scale neural activity with increasing spatiotemporal resolution, and provided opportunities for developing robust analytic methods to identify memory replay. In this paper, we first review a large body of historically important and representative memory replay studies from the animal and human literature. We then discuss our current understanding of memory replay functions in learning, planning and memory consolidation, and further discuss the progress in computational modeling that has contributed to these improvements. Next, we review the past and present analytic methods for replay analyses and discuss their limitations and challenges. Finally, looking ahead, we discuss some promising analytic methods for detecting non-stereotypical, behaviorally non-decodable structures from large-scale neural recordings. We argue that seamless integration of multi-site recordings, real-time replay decoding and closed-loop manipulation experiments will be essential for delineating the role of memory replay in a wide range of cognitive and motor functions."}
