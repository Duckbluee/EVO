{"abstract":"Most existing part-based tracking methods are part-to-part trackers, which usually have two separated steps including the part matching and target localization. Different from existing methods, in this paper, we propose a novel part-to-target (P2T) tracker in a unified fashion by inferring target location from parts directly. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel deep regression model for P2T regression in an end-to-end framework via convolutional neural networks. The proposed model is designed not only to exploit the part context information to preserve object spatial layout structure, but also to learn part reliability to emphasize part importance for the robust P2T regression. We evaluate the proposed tracker on four challenging benchmark sequences, and extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art trackers because of the powerful capacity of the proposed deep regression model."}
