{"abstract":"Accurately sensing the surrounding 3D scene is indispensable for drones or robots to execute path planning and navigation. In this paper, a novel monocular depth estimation method was proposed that primarily utilizes a lighter-weight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structure for coarse depth prediction and then refines the coarse depth images by combining surface normal guidance. Specifically, the coarse depth prediction network is designed as pre-trained encoder–decoder architecture for describing the 3D structure. When it comes to surface normal estimation, the deep learning network was designed as a two-stream encoder–decoder structure, which hierarchically merges red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) images for capturing more accurate geometric boundaries. Relying on fewer network parameters and simpler learning structure, better detailed depth maps are produced than the existing states. Moreover, 3D point cloud maps reconstructed from depth prediction images confirm that our framework can be conveniently adopted as components of a monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) paradigm."}
