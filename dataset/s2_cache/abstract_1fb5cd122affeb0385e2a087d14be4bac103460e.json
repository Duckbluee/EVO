{"abstract":"Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has experienced a significant growth over the last few years. This is due to the widespread application of machine learning, particularly deep learning, that has led to the development of highly accurate models but lack explainability and interpretability. A plethora of methods to tackle this problem have been proposed, developed and tested. This systematic review contributes to the body of knowledge by clustering these methods with a hierarchical classification system with four main clusters: review articles, theories and notions, methods and their evaluation. It also summarises the state-of-the-art in XAI and recommends future research directions."}
