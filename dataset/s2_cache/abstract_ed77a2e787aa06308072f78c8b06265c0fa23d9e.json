{"abstract":"In this paper, we aim at addressing two critical issues in the 3D detection task, including the exploitation of multiple sensors~(namely LiDAR point cloud and camera image), as well as the inconsistency between the localization and classification confidence. To this end, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance the point features with semantic image features in a point-wise manner without any image annotations. Besides, a consistency enforcing loss is employed to explicitly encourage the consistency of both the localization and classification confidence. We design an end-to-end learnable framework named EPNet to integrate these two components. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and SUN-RGBD datasets demonstrate the superiority of EPNet over the state-of-the-art methods. Codes and models are available at: \\url{this https URL}."}
