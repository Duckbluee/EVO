{"abstract":"Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently played a dominant role in multimodal vision-language learning. Despite the great success, it lacks a holistic evaluation of their efficacy. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of publicly available large multimodal models by building an LVLM evaluation Hub (LVLM-eHub). Our LVLM-eHub consists of 13 representative LVLMs such as InstructBLIP and LLaVA, which are thoroughly evaluated by a quantitative capability evaluation and an online arena platform. The former evaluates five categories of multimodal capabilities of LVLMs such as visual question answering and object hallucination on 42 in-domain text-related visual benchmarks, while the latter provides the user-level evaluation of LVLMs in an open-world question-answering scenario. The study investigates how specific features of LVLMs such as model configurations, modality alignment mechanisms, and training data affect the multimodal understanding. By conducting a comprehensive comparison of these features on quantitative and arena evaluation, our study uncovers several innovative findings, which establish a fundamental framework for the development and evaluation of innovative strategies aimed at enhancing multimodal techniques."}
