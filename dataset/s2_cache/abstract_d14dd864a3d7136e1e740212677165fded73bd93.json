{"abstract":"The output of a differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assay is a series of melt curves, which need to be interpreted to get value from the assay. An application that translates raw thermal melt curve data into more easily assimilated knowledge is described. This program, called “Meltdown,” conducts four main activities—control checks, curve normalization, outlier rejection, and melt temperature (Tm) estimation—and performs optimally in the presence of triplicate (or higher) sample data. The final output is a report that summarizes the results of a DSF experiment. The goal of Meltdown is not to replace human analysis of the raw fluorescence data but to provide a meaningful and comprehensive interpretation of the data to make this useful experimental technique accessible to inexperienced users, as well as providing a starting point for detailed analyses by more experienced users."}
