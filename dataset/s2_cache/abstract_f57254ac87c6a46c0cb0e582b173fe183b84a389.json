{"abstract":"Although interactive learning puts the user into the loop, the learner remains mostly a black box for the user. Understanding the reasons behind predictions and queries is important when assessing how the learner works and, in turn, trust. Consequently, we propose the novel framework of explanatory interactive learning where, in each step, the learner explains its query to the user, and the user interacts by both answering the query and correcting the explanation. We demonstrate that this can boost the predictive and explanatory powers of, and the trust into, the learned model, using text (e.g. SVMs) and image classification (e.g. neural networks) experiments as well as a user study."}
