{"abstract":"The research activities on natural language >rocessing of the FGCS Project are presented, linguistic phenomena are formalized in terms of :omplex structures and constraints on them. The logic programming paradigm is adopted for implementing natural language processing systems because the basic operation for the complex structures is isomorphic with respect to unification. DUALS (Discourse Understanding Aimed at Logic-based System), CIL (Complex Indeterminate Language), and JPSG (Japanese Phrase Structure Grammar) are being developed using the unification-based approach. The large-scale machine readable and understandable dictionaries are also being developed."}
