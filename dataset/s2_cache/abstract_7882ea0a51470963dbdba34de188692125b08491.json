{"abstract":"We propose SimSC, a remarkably simple framework, to address the problem of semantic matching only based on the feature backbone. We discover that when fine-tuning ImageNet pre-trained backbone on the semantic matching task, L2 normalization of the feature map, a standard procedure in feature matching, produces an overly smooth matching distribution and significantly hinders the fine-tuning process. By setting an appropriate temperature to the softmax, this over-smoothness can be alleviated and the quality of features can be substantially improved. We employ a learning module to predict the optimal temperature for fine-tuning feature backbones. This module is trained together with the backbone and the temperature is updated online. We evaluate our method on three public datasets and demonstrate that we can achieve accuracy on par with state-of-the-art methods under the same backbone without using a learned matching head. Our method is versatile and works on various types of backbones. We show that the accuracy of our framework can be easily improved by coupling it with more powerful backbones."}
