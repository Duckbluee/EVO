{"abstract":"We propose two novel dynamic event-triggered control laws to solve the average consensus problem for first-order continuous-time multiagent systems over undirected graphs. Compared with the most existing triggering laws, the proposed laws involve internal dynamic variables, which play an essential role in guaranteeing that the triggering time sequence does not exhibit Zeno behavior. Moreover, some existing triggering laws are special cases of ours. For the proposed self-triggered algorithm, continuous agent listening is avoided as each agent predicts its next triggering time and broadcasts it to its neighbors at the current triggering time. Thus, each agent only needs to sense and broadcast at its triggering times, and to listen to and receive incoming information from its neighbors at their triggering times. It is proved that the proposed triggering laws make the state of each agent converge exponentially to the average of the agents’ initial states if and only if the underlying graph is connected. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results."}
