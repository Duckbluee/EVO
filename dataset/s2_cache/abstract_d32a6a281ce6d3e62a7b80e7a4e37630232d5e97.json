{"abstract":"This Python module uses matplotlib (Hunter 2007) to visualize multidimensional samples using a scatterplot matrix. In these visualizations, each oneand two-dimensional projection of the sample is plotted to reveal covariances. corner was originally conceived to display the results of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations and the defaults are chosen with this application in mind but it can be used for displaying many qualitatively different samples."}
