{"abstract":"We consider a distributed empirical risk minimization (ERM) optimization problem with communication efficiency and privacy requirements, motivated by the federated learning (FL) framework (Kairouz <italic>et al</italic>., 2019). Unique challenges to the traditional ERM problem in the context of FL include <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\textsf{(i)}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> need to provide privacy guarantees on clients’ data, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\textsf{(ii)}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> compress the communication between clients and the server, since clients might have low-bandwidth links, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\textsf{(iii)}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> work with a dynamic client population at each round of communication between the server and the clients, as a small fraction of clients are sampled at each round. To address these challenges we develop (optimal) communication-efficient schemes for private mean estimation for several <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\ell _{p}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> spaces, enabling efficient gradient aggregation for each iteration of the optimization solution of the ERM. We also provide lower and upper bounds for mean estimation with privacy and communication constraints for arbitrary <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\ell _{p}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> spaces. To get the overall communication, privacy, and optimization performance operation point, we combine this with privacy amplification opportunities inherent to this setup. Our solution takes advantage of the inherent privacy amplification provided by client sampling and data sampling at each client (through Stochastic Gradient Descent) as well as the recently developed privacy framework using anonymization, which effectively presents to the server responses that are randomly shuffled with respect to the clients. Putting these together, we demonstrate that one can get the same privacy, optimization-performance operating point developed in recent methods that use full-precision communication, but at a much lower communication cost, i.e., effectively getting communication efficiency for “free”."}
