{"abstract":"While there are novel point cloud semantic segmentation schemes that continuously surpass state-of-the-art results, the success of learning an effective model usually rely on the availability of abundant labeled data. However, data annotation is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task, particularly for large-scale airborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds involving multiple classes in urban areas. Thus, how to attain promising results while largely reducing labeling works become an essential issue. In this study, we propose a deep-learning based weakly supervised framework for semantic segmentation of ALS point clouds, exploiting potential information from unlabeled data subject to incomplete and sparse labels. Entropy regularization is introduced to penalize the class overlap in predictive probability. Additionally, a consistency constraint by minimizing the discrepancy distance between instant and ensemble predictions is designed to improve the robustness of predictions. Finally, we propose an online soft pseudo-labeling strategy to create extra supervisory sources in an efficient and nonpaprametric way. Extensive experimental analysis using three benchmark datasets demonstrates that in case of sparse point annotations, our proposed method significantly boosts the classification performance without compromising the computational efficiency. It outperforms current weakly supervised methods and achieves a comparable result against full supervision competitors. For the ISPRS 3D Labeling Vaihingen data, by using only 0.1% of labels, our method achieves an overall accuracy of 83.0% and an average F1 score of 70.0%, which have increased by 6.9% and 12.8% respectively, compared to model trained by sparse label information only."}
