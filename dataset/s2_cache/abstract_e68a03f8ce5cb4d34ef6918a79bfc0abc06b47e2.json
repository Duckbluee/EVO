{"abstract":"\n \n A touted use of Procedural Content Generation is generating content tailored to specific players. Previous work has relied on human identification of player profile features which are then mapped to level generator features. We present a machine-learned technique to train generators on Super Mario Bros. videos, generating levels based on latent play styles learned from the video. We evaluate the generators in comparison to the original levels and a machine-learned generator trained using simulated players.\n \n"}
