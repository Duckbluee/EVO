{"abstract":"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on various tasks. To unleash their power on the Text-to-SQL task, we propose $R^3$ (Review-Rebuttal-Revision), a consensus-based multi-agent system for Text-to-SQL tasks. $R^3$ outperforms the existing single LLM Text-to-SQL systems as well as the multi-agent Text-to-SQL systems by $1.3\\%$ to $8.1\\%$ on Spider and Bird. Surprisingly, we find that for Llama-3-8B, $R^3$ outperforms chain-of-thought prompting by over 20\\%, even outperforming GPT-3.5 on the development set of Spider."}
