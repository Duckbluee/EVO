{"abstract":"We propose a method for generalizing deep learning for 3D point cloud registration on new, totally different datasets. It is based on two components, MS-SVConv and UDGE. Using Multi-Scale Sparse Voxel Convolution, MSSVConv is a fast deep neural network that outputs the descriptors from point clouds for 3D registration between two scenes. UDGE is an algorithm for transferring deep networks on unknown datasets in a unsupervised way. The interest of the proposed method appears while using the two components, MS-SVConv and UDGE, together as a whole, which leads to state-of-the-art results on real world registration datasets such as 3DMatch, ETH and TUM. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/humanpose1/MS-SVConv."}
