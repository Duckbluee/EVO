{"abstract":"This study aimed to develop an intuitive gait-related motor imagery (MI)-based hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) controller for a lower-limb exoskeleton and investigate the feasibility of the controller under a practical scenario including stand-up, gait-forward, and sit-down. A filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) and mutual information-based best individual feature (MIBIF) selection were used in the study to decode MI electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and extract a feature matrix as an input to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. A successive eye-blink switch was sequentially combined with the EEG decoder in operating the lower-limb exoskeleton. Ten subjects demonstrated more than 80% accuracy in both offline (training) and online. All subjects successfully completed a gait task by wearing the lower-limb exoskeleton through the developed real-time BCI controller. The BCI controller achieved a time ratio of 1.45 compared with a manual smartwatch controller. The developed system can potentially be benefit people with neurological disorders who may have difficulties operating manual control."}
