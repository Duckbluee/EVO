{"abstract":"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs within a business context. Specifically, we employ LLMs to devise a sales strategy geared towards maximizing customer values (benefits and satisfaction). This sales plan encompasses five iterative stages: market landscape survey, customer profiling, product usage analysis, sales strategy formulation, and crafting persuasive pitches and materials. We leverage LLMs to supplement the limited data available to the company, aiming to enhance the efficacy of each stage and optimize KPIs, including the value-oriented sales conversion and profitability. Due to confidentiality and trade secret concerns, we blend artificial data with genuine data to ensure customer anonymity and protect sales playbooks. Despite these precautions, we effectively demonstrate our methodology of harnessing LLMs to refine the sales planning procedure."}
