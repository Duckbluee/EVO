{"abstract":"Semantic communication has emerged as a revolutionary paradigm within wireless edge networks, showcasing remarkable communication efficiency. In contrast to traditional bit-level communication systems, semantic communication systems exhibit superior effectiveness and precision, particularly in scenarios characterized by low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Nonetheless, the privacy of semantic communication poses a critical challenge that demands attention. Once the attacker intercepts the semantic information through continuous eaves-dropping, the private data would be leaked under adversarial environment. Moreover, in low SNR scenario, joint optimization of anti -eavesdropping and privacy reconstruction has not yet been studied, coupled with the intricate nature of designing a cross-layer semantic protection strategy. To address this concern, this paper presents a covert and reliable semantic communication (CRSC) framework via full-duplex receiver to counter continuous eavesdropper by concealing the entire transmission process. Furthermore, a newly-defined metric, namely covert semantic throughput (CST), is introduced to quantify the system's performance. Furthermore, we formulate the maximization of average CST during the semantic transmission period as a multi-constraint optimization problem. Subsequently, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-empowered adaptation algorithm to address the formulated problem. Through simulation results, the effectiveness and feasibility of proposed CRSC framework are demonstrated, with an observed maximum average CST improvement of up to 42% compared to conventional communication systems in the low SNR scenario."}
