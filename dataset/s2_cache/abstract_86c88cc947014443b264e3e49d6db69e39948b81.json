{"abstract":"Increasingly, the web produces massive volumes of texts, alone or associated with images, videos, photographs, together with some metadata, indispensable for their finding and retrieval. Keywords/keyphrases that characterize the semantic content of documents should be, automatically or manually, extracted, and/or associated with them. The paper presents a novel method to address the problem of the automatic unsupervised extraction of keywords/phrases from texts, expressed both in English and in Italian. The main feature of this approach is the integration of two methods that have given interesting results: word embedding models, such as Word2Vec or GloVe able to capture the semantics of words and their context, and clustering algorithms, able to identify the essence of the terms and choose the more significant one(s), to represent the contents of a text. In the paper, the datasets used are presented, together with the method implemented and the results obtained. These results will be discussed, commented, and compared with those obtained in previous experimentations, using TextRank, Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE), and TF-IDF."}
