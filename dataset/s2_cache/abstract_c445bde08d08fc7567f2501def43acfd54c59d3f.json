{"abstract":"Block designs were first used in the design of experiments in statistics, as a method for coping with systematic differences in the experimental material. Suppose, for example, that we want to test seven different varieties of seed in an agricultural experiment, and have 21 plots of land available for the experiment. If the plots can be regarded as identical, then the best strategy is clearly to plant three plots with each variety. Suppose, however, that the available plots are on seven farms in different regions, with three plots on each farm. If we simply plant one variety on each farm, we lose information, because we cannot distinguish systematic differences between regions from differences in the seed varieties. It is better to follow a scheme like this: plant varieties 1, 2, 3 on the first farm; 1, 4, 5 on the second; and then 1, 6, 7; 2, 4, 6; 2, 5, 7; 3, 4, 7; and 3, 5, 6. This design can be represented by a picture:"}
