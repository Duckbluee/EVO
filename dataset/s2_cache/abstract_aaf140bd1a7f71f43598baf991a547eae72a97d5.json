{"abstract":"We present SurgeonAssist-Net: a lightweight framework making action-and-workflow-driven virtual assistance, for a set of predefined surgical tasks, accessible to commercially available optical see-through head-mounted displays (OST-HMDs). On a widely used benchmark dataset for laparoscopic surgical workflow, our implementation competes with state-of-the-art approaches in prediction accuracy for automated task recognition, and yet requires 7.4x fewer parameters, 10.2x fewer floating point operations per second (FLOPS), is 7.0x faster for inference on a CPU, and is capable of near real-time performance on the Microsoft HoloLens 2 OST-HMD. To achieve this, we make use of an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone to extract discriminative features from image data, and a low-parameter recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to learn long-term temporal dependencies. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for inference on the HoloLens 2 we created a sample dataset that included video of several surgical tasks recorded from a user-centric point-of-view. After training, we deployed our model and cataloged its performance in an online simulated surgical scenario for the prediction of the current surgical task. The utility of our approach is explored in the discussion of several relevant clinical use-cases. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/doughtmw/surgeon-assist-net."}
