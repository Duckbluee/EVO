{"abstract":"The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), set to take effect in January 2020, establishes new consumer privacy rights and expands liability for consumer data breaches. Failure to comply for organizations that conduct business in California could lead to regulatory enforcement actions, legal action, and a loss of customer trust. With similarities to the European Union’s GDPR, CCPA is the strictest privacy legislation in the U.S. currently."}
