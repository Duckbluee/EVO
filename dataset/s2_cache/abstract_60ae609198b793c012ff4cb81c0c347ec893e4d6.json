{"abstract":"Perception is the fundamental task of any autonomous driving system, which gathers all the necessary information about the surrounding environment of the moving vehicle. The decision-making system takes the perception data as input and makes the optimum decision given that scenario, which maximizes the safety of the passengers. This paper surveyed recent literature on autonomous vehicle perception (AVP) by focusing on two primary tasks: Semantic Segmentation and Object Detection. Both tasks play an important role as a vital component of the vehicle’s navigation system. A comprehensive overview of deep learning for perception and its decision-making process based on images and LiDAR point clouds is discussed. We discussed the sensors, benchmark datasets, and simulation tools widely used in semantic segmentation and object detection tasks, especially for autonomous driving. This paper acts as a road map for current and future research in AVP, focusing on models, assessment, and challenges in the field."}
