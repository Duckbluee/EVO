{"abstract":"Recent advancements in computer-assisted learning systems have caused an increase in the research in knowledge tracing, wherein student performance is predicted over time. Student coursework can potentially be structured as a graph. Incorporating this graph-structured nature into a knowledge tracing model as a relational inductive bias can improve its performance; however, previous methods, such as deep knowledge tracing, did not consider such a latent graph structure. Inspired by the recent successes of graph neural networks (GNNs), we herein propose a GNN-based knowledge tracing method, i.e., graph-based knowledge tracing. Casting the knowledge structure as a graph enabled us to reformulate the knowledge tracing task as a time-series node-level classification problem in the GNN. As the knowledge graph structure is not explicitly provided in most cases, we propose various implementations of the graph structure. Empirical validations on two open datasets indicated that our method could potentially improve the prediction of student performance and demonstrated more interpretable predictions compared to those of the previous methods, without the requirement of any additional information."}
