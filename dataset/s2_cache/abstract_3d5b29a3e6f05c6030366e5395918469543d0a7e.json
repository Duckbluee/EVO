{"abstract":"MOTIVATION\nAccurate and efficient prediction of molecular properties is one of the fundamental issues in drug design and discovery pipelines. Traditional feature engineering-based approaches require extensive expertise in the feature design and selection process. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, data-driven methods exhibit unparalleled advantages over the feature engineering-based methods in various domains. Nevertheless, when applied to molecular property prediction, AI models usually suffer from the scarcity of labeled data and show poor generalization ability.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn this study, we proposed molecular graph BERT (MG-BERT), which integrates the local message passing mechanism of graph neural networks (GNNs) into the powerful BERT model to facilitate learning from molecular graphs. Furthermore, an effective self-supervised learning strategy named masked atoms prediction was proposed to pretrain the MG-BERT model on a large amount of unlabeled data to mine context information in molecules. We found the MG-BERT model can generate context-sensitive atomic representations after pretraining and transfer the learned knowledge to the prediction of a variety of molecular properties. The experimental results show that the pretrained MG-BERT model with a little extra fine-tuning can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art methods on all 11 ADMET datasets. Moreover, the MG-BERT model leverages attention mechanisms to focus on atomic features essential to the target property, providing excellent interpretability for the trained model. The MG-BERT model does not require any hand-crafted feature as input and is more reliable due to its excellent interpretability, providing a novel framework to develop state-of-the-art models for a wide range of drug discovery tasks."}
