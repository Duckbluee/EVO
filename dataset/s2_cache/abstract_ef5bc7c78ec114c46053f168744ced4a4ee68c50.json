{"abstract":"The tremendous success of graphical neural networks (GNNs) has already had a major impact on systems biology research. For example, GNNs are currently used for drug target recognition in protein-drug interaction networks as well as cancer gene discovery and more. Important aspects whose practical relevance is often underestimated are comprehensibility, interpretability, and explainability. In this work, we present a graph-based deep learning framework for disease subnetwork detection via explainable GNNs. In our framework, each patient is represented by the topology of a protein-protein network (PPI), and the nodes are enriched by molecular multimodal data, such as gene expression and DNA methylation. Therefore, our novel modification of the GNNexplainer for model-wide explanations can detect potential disease subnetworks, which is of high practical relevance. The proposed methods are implemented in the GNN-SubNet Python program, which we have made freely available on our GitHub for the international research community (https://github.com/pievos101/GNN-SubNet)."}
