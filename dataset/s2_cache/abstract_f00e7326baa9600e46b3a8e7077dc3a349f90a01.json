{"abstract":"Structured product data in the form of attribute/value pairs is the foundation of many e-commerce applications such as faceted product search, product comparison, and product recommendation. Product offers often only contain textual descriptions of the product attributes in the form of titles or free text. Hence, extracting attribute/value pairs from textual product descriptions is an essential enabler for e-commerce applications. In order to excel, state-of-the-art product information extraction methods require large quantities of task-specific training data. The methods also struggle with generalizing to out-of-distribution attributes and attribute values that were not a part of the training data. Due to being pre-trained on huge amounts of text as well as due to emergent effects resulting from the model size, Large Language Models like ChatGPT have the potential to address both of these shortcomings. This paper explores the potential of ChatGPT for extracting attribute/value pairs from product descriptions. We experiment with different zero-shot and few-shot prompt designs. Our results show that ChatGPT achieves a performance similar to a pre-trained language model but requires much smaller amounts of training data and computation for fine-tuning."}
