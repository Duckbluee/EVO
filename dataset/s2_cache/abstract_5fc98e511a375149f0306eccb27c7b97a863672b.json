{"abstract":"Nowadays, general object detectors like YOLO and Faster R-CNN as well as their variants are widely exploited in many applications. Many works have revealed that these detectors are extremely vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks. The perturbed regions generated by previous patch-based attack works on object detectors are very large which are not necessary for attacking and perceptible for human eyes. To generate much less but more efficient perturbation, we propose a novel patch-based method for attacking general object detectors. Firstly, we propose a patch selection and refining scheme to find the pixels which have the greatest importance for attack and remove the inconsequential perturbations gradually. Then, for a stable ensemble attack, we balance the gradients of detectors to avoid over-optimizing one of them during the training phase. Our RPAttack can achieve an amazing missed detection rate of 100% for both Yolo v4 and Faster R-CNN while only modifies 0.32% pixels on VOC 2007 test set. Our code is available at https://github.com/VDIGPKU/RPAttack."}
