{"abstract":"The emerging federated optimization paradigm performs data mining or artificial intelligence techniques locally on the edge devices, enabling scientists and engineers to utilize the blooming edge data with privacy protection. In such a paradigm, since data cannot be shared or gathered, data heterogeneity naturally emerges, which significantly degrades the performance of federated optimization, ultimately leading to poor quality of federated services. In this paper, we present the first work on characterizing the data heterogeneity in the framework of federated analytics, i.e., to collectively carry out analytics tasks without raw data sharing, and use the information to create a desirable data environment via intelligent client selection. Our proposed Analytics-driven Client Selection framework, named FedACS, tackles the data heterogeneity problem in three steps. First, clients are in charge of generating insights about local data without disclosure of sensitive information. Then, the server uses these insights to infer the situation of clients’ data heterogeneity based on the Hoeffding’s inequality. Finally, a dueling bandit is formulated to intelligently select clients with slighter data heterogeneity to form a desirable client pool. FedACS can be universally applied to all kinds of federated optimization tasks, and gains benefits including privacy protection, infrastructure reuse, and client load reduction. To test its efficiency, we further customize it to assist federated learning, a popular scenario of federated optimization. According to experiment results, FedACS reduces the accuracy degrading by up to 65.6%, and speeds up the convergence for up to 2.4 times."}
