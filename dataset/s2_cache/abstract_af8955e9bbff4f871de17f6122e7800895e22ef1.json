{"abstract":"Multiple kernel clustering (MKC) is committed to achieving optimal information fusion from a set of base kernels. Constructing precise and local kernel matrices is proven to be of vital significance in applications since the unreliable distant–distance similarity estimation would degrade clustering performance. Although existing localized MKC algorithms exhibit improved performance compared with globally designed competitors, most of them widely adopt the KNN mechanism to localize kernel matrix by accounting for $\\tau $ -nearest neighbors. However, such a coarse manner follows an unreasonable strategy that the ranking importance of different neighbors is equal, which is impractical in applications. To alleviate such problems, this article proposes a novel local sample-weighted MKC (LSWMKC) model. We first construct a consensus discriminative affinity graph in kernel space, revealing the latent local structures. Furthermore, an optimal neighborhood kernel for the learned affinity graph is output with naturally sparse property and clear block diagonal structure. Moreover, LSWMKC implicitly optimizes adaptive weights on different neighbors with corresponding samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our LSWMKC possesses better local manifold representation and outperforms existing kernel or graph-based clustering algorithms. The source code of LSWMKC can be publicly accessed from https://github.com/liliangnudt/LSWMKC."}
