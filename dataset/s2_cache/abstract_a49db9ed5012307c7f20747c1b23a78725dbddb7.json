{"abstract":"This paper considers the multi-dimensional consensus in networked systems, where some of the agents might be misbehaving (or faulty). Despite the influence of these misbehaviors, the healthy agents aim to reach an agreement within the convex hull of their initial states. Towards this end, this paper develops a resilient consensus algorithm, where each healthy agent sorts its received values on one dimension, computes two \"middle points\" based on the sorted values, and moves its state toward these middle points. We further show that the computation of middle points can be efficiently achieved by linear programming. Compared with the existing works, this approach has lower computational complexity. Assuming that the number of malicious agents is upper bounded, sufficient conditions on the network topology are then presented to guarantee the achievement of resilient consensus. Some numerical examples are finally provided to verify the theoretical results."}
