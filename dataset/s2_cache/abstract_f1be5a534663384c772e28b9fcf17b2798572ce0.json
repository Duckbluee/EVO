{"abstract":"Multiview learning has made significant progress in recent years. However, an implicit assumption is that multiview data are complete, which is often contrary to practical applications. Due to human or data acquisition equipment errors, what we actually get is partial multiview data, which existing multiview algorithms are limited to processing. Modeling complex dependencies between views in terms of consistency and complementarity remains challenging, especially in partial multiview data scenarios. To address the above issues, this article proposes a deep Gaussian cross-view generation model (named PMvCG), which aims to model views according to the principles of consistency and complementarity and eventually learn the comprehensive representation of partial multiview data. PMvCG can discover cross-view associations by learning view-sharing and view-specific features of different views in the representation space. The missing views can be reconstructed and are applied in turn to further optimize the model. The estimated uncertainty in the model is also considered and integrated into the representation to improve the performance. We design a variational inference and iterative optimization algorithm to solve PMvCG effectively. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets to validate the performance of PMvCG. We compare the PMvCG with various methods by applying the learned representation to clustering and classification. We also provide more insightful analysis to explore the PMvCG, such as convergence analysis, parameter sensitivity analysis, and the effect of uncertainty in the representation. The experimental results indicate that PMvCG obtains promising results and surpasses other comparative methods under different experimental settings."}
