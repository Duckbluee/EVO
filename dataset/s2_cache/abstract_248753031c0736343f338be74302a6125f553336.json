{"abstract":"Object detection plays an important role in security-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles but has shown to be vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks. Existing defense methods are restricted to localized noise patches by removing noisy regions in the input image. However, adversarial patches have developed into natural-looking patterns which evade existing defenses. To address this issue, we propose a defense method based on a novel concept \"Adversarial Patch- Feature Energy\" (APE) which exploits common deep feature characteristics of an adversarial patch. Our proposed defense consists of APE-masking and APE-refinement which can be employed to defend against any adversarial patch on literature. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APE-based defense achieves impressive robustness against adversarial patches both in the digital space and the physical world."}
