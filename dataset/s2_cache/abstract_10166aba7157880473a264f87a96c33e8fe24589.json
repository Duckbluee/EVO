{"abstract":"With the extensive application of automated guided vehicles, real-time production scheduling considering logistics services in cloud manufacturing (CM) becomes an urgent problem. Thus, this study focuses on the distributed real-time scheduling (DRTS) of multiple services to respond to dynamic and customized orders. First, a DRTS framework with cloud–edge collaboration is proposed to improve performance and satisfy responsiveness, where distributed actors and one centralized learner are deployed in the edge and cloud layer, respectively. And, the DRTS problem is modeled as a semi-Markov decision process, where the processing services sequencing and logistics services assignment are considered simultaneously. Then, we developed a distributed dueling deep Q network (D3QN) with cloud–edge collaboration to optimize the weighted tardiness of jobs. The experimental results show that the proposed D3QN obtains lower weighted tardiness and shorter flow-time than other state-of-the-art algorithms. It indicates the proposed DRTS method has significant potential to provide efficient real-time decision-making in CM."}
