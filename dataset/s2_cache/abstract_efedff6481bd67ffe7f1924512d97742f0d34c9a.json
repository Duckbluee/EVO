{"abstract":"As GAN-based video and image manipulation technologies become more sophisticated and easily accessible, there is an urgent need for effective deepfake detection technologies. Moreover, various deepfake generation techniques have emerged over the past few years. While many deepfake detection methods have been proposed, their performance suffers from new types of deepfake methods on which they are not sufficiently trained. To detect new types of deepfakes, the model should learn from additional data without losing its prior knowledge about deepfakes (catastrophic forgetting), especially when new deepfakes are significantly different. In this work, we employ the Representation Learning (ReL) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigms to introduce a transfer learning-based Feature Representation Transfer Adaptation Learning (FReTAL) method. We use FReTAL to perform domain adaptation tasks on new deepfake datasets, while minimizing the catastrophic forgetting. Our student model can quickly adapt to new types of deepfake by distilling knowledge from a pre-trained teacher model and applying transfer learning without using source domain data during domain adaptation. Through experiments on FaceForensics++ datasets, we demonstrate that FReTAL outperforms all baselines on the domain adaptation task with up to 86.97% accuracy on low-quality deepfakes."}
