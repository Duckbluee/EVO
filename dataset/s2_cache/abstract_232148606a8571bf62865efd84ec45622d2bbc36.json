{"abstract":"We show that people’s perceptions of public figures’ personalities can be accurately predicted from their names’ location in GPT-3’s semantic space. We collected Big Five personality perceptions of 226 public figures from 600 human raters. Cross-validated linear regression was used to predict human perceptions from public figures’ name embeddings extracted from GPT-3. The models’ accuracy ranged from r = .78 to .88 without controls and from r = .53 to .70 when controlling for public figures’ likability and demographics, after correcting for attenuation. Prediction models showed high face validity as revealed by the personality-descriptive adjectives occupying their extremes. Our findings reveal that GPT-3 word embeddings capture signals pertaining to individual differences and intimate traits."}
