{"abstract":"Sequential Recommendation (SR) plays a pivotal role in recommender systems by tailoring recommendations to user preferences based on their non-stationary historical interactions. Achieving high-quality performance in SR requires attention to both item representation and diversity. However, designing an SR method that simultaneously optimizes these merits remains a long-standing challenge. In this study, we address this issue by integrating recent generative Diffusion Models (DM) into SR. DM has demonstrated utility in representation learning and diverse image generation. Nevertheless, a straightforward combination of SR and DM leads to sub-optimal performance due to discrepancies in learning objectives (recommendation vs. noise reconstruction) and the respective learning spaces (non-stationary vs. stationary). To overcome this, we propose a novel framework called DimeRec (Di ffusion with multi-interest enhanced Rec ommender). DimeRec synergistically combines a guidance extraction module (GEM) and a generative diffusion aggregation module (DAM). The GEM extracts crucial stationary guidance signals from the user's non-stationary interaction history, while the DAM employs a generative diffusion process conditioned on GEM's outputs to reconstruct and generate consistent recommendations. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that DimeRec significantly outperforms established baseline methods across three publicly available datasets. Furthermore, we have successfully deployed DimeRec on a large-scale short video recommendation platform, serving hundreds of millions of users. Live A/B testing confirms that our method improves both users' time spent and result diversification."}
