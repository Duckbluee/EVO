{"abstract":"Trust evaluation assesses trust relationships between entities and facilitates decision-making. Machine Learning (ML) shows great potential for trust evaluation owing to its learning capabilities. In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), as a new ML paradigm, have demonstrated superiority in dealing with graph data. This has motivated researchers to explore their use in trust evaluation, as trust relationships among entities can be modeled as a graph. However, current trust evaluation methods that employ GNNs fail to fully satisfy the dynamic nature of trust, overlook the adverse effects of trust-related attacks, and cannot provide convincing explanations on evaluation results. To address these problems, we propose TrustGuard, a GNN-based accurate trust evaluation model that supports trust dynamicity, is robust against typical attacks, and provides explanations through visualization. Specifically, TrustGuard is designed with a layered architecture that contains a snapshot input layer, a spatial aggregation layer, a temporal aggregation layer, and a prediction layer. Among them, the spatial aggregation layer adopts a defense mechanism to robustly aggregate local trust, and the temporal aggregation layer applies an attention mechanism for effective learning of temporal patterns. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that TrustGuard outperforms state-of-the-art GNN-based trust evaluation models with respect to trust prediction across single-timeslot and multi-timeslot, even in the presence of attacks. In addition, TrustGuard can explain its evaluation results by visualizing both spatial and temporal views."}
