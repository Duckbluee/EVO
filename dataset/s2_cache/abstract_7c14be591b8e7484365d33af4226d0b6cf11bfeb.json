{"abstract":"Recently deep neural networks have been applied to skin lesion recognition to learn feature representations, among which segmentation masks have been proved effective in enhancing the recognition performance by making the classifier network focus on the region of interest. However, high-quality segmentations for skin images require expert doctors and are a cumbersome task in terms of time and labor. Although some open-sourced segmentation models for similar tasks could help produce segmentation masks, employing them directly would bring unpredictable mismatches because of the concept drift effect. To tackle this issue, we propose an Uncertainty-based Fusion Network (UFN) for skin lesion diagnosis, which tries to robustly fuse a trained or open-sourced segmentation model with the target skin lesion classification task. To mitigate the negative influence of the segmentation mismatch, UFN uses the Dirichlet distribution to model the uncertainty and probabilities of multi-level representations. Then modified Dempster-Shafer theory is introduced to fuse the segmentation and classification representations adaptively. Moreover, the multi-level fused representations are unequally weighted by an attention mechanism. Furthermore, UFN integrates the label supervision for every fused representation as well as the weighted representations. The extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets demonstrated the superiority of UFN compared with state-of-the-art methods."}
