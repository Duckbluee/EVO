{"abstract":"Transfer learning is an emerging technique in machine learning, by which we can solve a new task with the knowledge obtained from an old task in order to address the lack of labeled data. In particular deep domain adaptation (a branch of transfer learning) gets the most attention in recently published articles. The intuition behind this is that deep neural networks usually have a large capacity to learn representation from one dataset and part of the information can be further used for a new task. In this research, we firstly present the complete scenarios of transfer learning according to the domains and tasks. Secondly, we conduct a comprehensive survey related to deep domain adaptation and categorize the recent advances into three types based on implementing approaches: fine-tuning networks, adversarial domain adaptation, and sample-reconstruction approaches. Thirdly, we discuss the details of these methods and introduce some typical real-world applications. Finally, we conclude our work and explore some potential issues to be further addressed."}
