{"abstract":"Generative AI technology is now capable of producing images and text at a level comparable to that of humans, showcasing its remarkable utility. However, this advancement comes with its share of challenges, such as misuse, prompting discussions on effective response strategies. Consequently, recommendations and regulations, including the adoption of watermark technology, are under deliberation on a country-by-country basis. Many companies are also integrating watermark technology into their services as a means of addressing this issue. This paper presents an analysis of the current status of watermark adoption across various countries and companies. Furthermore, it delves into further research topics that should be taken into account when implementing watermark technology. This analysis aims to provide valuable insights to those who are contemplating the implementation of watermarking in their future generative AI services."}
