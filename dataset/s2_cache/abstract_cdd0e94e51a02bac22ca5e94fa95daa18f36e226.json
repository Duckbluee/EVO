{"abstract":"Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) emerges as a promising paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, a notable challenge in RLHF is overoptimization, where beyond a certain threshold, the pursuit of higher rewards leads to a decline in human preferences. In this paper, we observe the weakness of KL regularization which is commonly employed in existing RLHF methods to address overoptimization. To mitigate this limitation, we scrutinize the RLHF objective in the offline dataset and propose uncertainty-penalized RLHF (UP-RLHF), which incorporates uncertainty regularization during RL-finetuning. To enhance the uncertainty quantification abilities for reward models, we first propose a diverse low-rank adaptation (LoRA) ensemble by maximizing the nuclear norm of LoRA matrix concatenations. Then we optimize policy models utilizing penalized rewards, determined by both rewards and uncertainties provided by the diverse reward LoRA ensembles. Our experimental results, based on two real human preference datasets, showcase the effectiveness of diverse reward LoRA ensembles in quantifying reward uncertainty. Additionally, uncertainty regularization in UP-RLHF proves to be pivotal in mitigating overoptimization, thereby contributing to the overall performance."}
