{"abstract":"Due to the inherent flexibility of prompting, foundation models have emerged as the predominant force in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision. The recent introduction of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) signifies a noteworthy expansion of the prompt-driven paradigm into the domain of image segmentation, thereby introducing a plethora of previously unexplored capabilities. However, the viability of its application to medical image segmentation remains uncertain, given the substantial distinctions between natural and medical images. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent endeavors aimed at extending the efficacy of SAM to medical image segmentation tasks, encompassing both empirical benchmarking and methodological adaptations. Additionally, we explore potential avenues for future research directions in SAM's role within medical image segmentation. While direct application of SAM to medical image segmentation does not yield satisfactory performance on multi-modal and multi-target medical datasets so far, numerous insights gleaned from these efforts serve as valuable guidance for shaping the trajectory of foundational models in the realm of medical image analysis. To support ongoing research endeavors, we maintain an active repository that contains an up-to-date paper list and a succinct summary of open-source projects at https://github.com/YichiZhang98/SAM4MIS."}
