{"abstract":"Graph encoding methods have been proven exceptionally useful in many classification tasks — from molecule toxicity prediction to social network recommendations. However, most of the existing methods are designed to work in a centralized environment that requires the whole graph to be kept in memory. Moreover, scaling them on very large networks remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a distributed and permutation invariant graph embedding method denoted as Distributed Graph Statistical Distance (DGSD) that extracts graph representation on independently distributed machines. DGSD finds nodes’ local proximity by considering only nodes’ degree, common neighbors and direct connectivity that allows it to run in the distributed environment. On the other hand, the linear space complexity of DGSD makes it suitable for processing large graphs. We show the scalability of DGSD on sufficiently large random and real-world networks and evaluate its performance on various bioinformatics and social networks with the implementation in a distributed computing environment. © 2021ElsevierB.V.Allrightsreserved."}
