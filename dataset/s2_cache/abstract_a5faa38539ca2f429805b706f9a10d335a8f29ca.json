{"abstract":"To address challenges in the digital economy’s landscape of digital intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have been developed. Improvements in computational power and available resources have significantly advanced LLMs, allowing their integration into diverse domains for human life. Medical LLMs are essential application tools with potential across various medical scenarios. In this paper, we review LLM developments, focusing on the requirements and applications of medical LLMs. We provide a concise overview of existing models, aiming to explore advanced research directions and benefit researchers for future medical applications. We emphasize the advantages of medical LLMs in applications, as well as the challenges encountered during their development. Finally, we suggest directions for technical integration to mitigate challenges and potential research directions for the future of medical LLMs, aiming to meet the demands of the medical field better."}
