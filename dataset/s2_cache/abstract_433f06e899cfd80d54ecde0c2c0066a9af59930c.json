{"abstract":"Trajectory clustering is a cornerstone task in trajectory mining. Sparse and noisy trajectories like Call Detail Records (CDR) have become popular with the rapid development of mobile applications. However, existing trajectory clustering methods' performance is limited on these trajectories. Therefore, we propose a dual Self-supervised Deep Trajectory Clustering (SDTC) method, to optimize trajectory representation and clustering jointly. First, we leverage the BERT model to learn spatial-temporal mobility patterns and incorporate them into the embeddings of location IDs. Second, we fine-tune the BERT model to learn cluster-friendly representations of trajectories by designing a dual self-supervised cluster layer, which improves the intra-cluster similarities and inter-cluster dissimilarities. Third, we conduct extensive experiments with two real-world datasets. Results show that SDTC improves the clustering accuracy by 12.1% (on a noisy and sparse dataset) and 3.8% (on a very sparse dataset) compared with SOTA deep clustering methods."}
