{"abstract":"The academic literature of social sciences records human civilization and studies human social problems. With its large-scale growth, the ways to quickly find existing research on relevant issues have become an urgent demand for researchers. Previous studies, such as SciBERT, have shown that pre-training using domain-specific texts can improve the performance of natural language processing tasks. However, the pre-trained language model for social sciences is not available so far. In light of this, the present research proposes a pre-trained model based on the abstracts published in the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) journals. The models, which are available on GitHub ( https://github.com/S-T-Full-Text-Knowledge-Mining/SSCI-BERT ), show excellent performance on discipline classification, abstract structure–function recognition, and named entity recognition tasks with the social sciences literature."}
