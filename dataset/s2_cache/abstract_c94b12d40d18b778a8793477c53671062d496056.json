{"abstract":"In this paper we shall describe key improvements to Dragon’s Broadcast News Transcription System, which include: the addition of a speaker-change detection algorithm to our preprocessing subsystem, a new diagonalizing transformation trained using semi-tied covariances, and the addition of probabilities on pronunciations. This new transcription system yields a word error rate of 15.2% on the 1997 evaluation test data, and 14.5% őn the 1998 evaluation test data."}
