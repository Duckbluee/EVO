{"abstract":"In the context of procedural content generation via machine learning (PCGML), quality-diversity (QD) algorithms are a powerful tool to generate diverse game content. A branch of QD uses genetic operators to generate content (e.g. MAP-Elites). Problematically, levels generated with these operators have no guarantee of matching the style of a game. This can be addressed by incorporating whether a level is generable by an n-gram into the fitness function. Unfortunately, this leads to wasted computation and poor results. In this work, we introduce n-gram genetic operators, which produce only solutions that are generable by the n-gram model; we call MAP-Elites combined with these operators Gram-Elites. We test on a tile-based side-scrolling platformer, vertical platformer, and roguelike. For all three, n-gram operators outperform standard operators and random n-gram generation, finding more usable (i.e. completable and generable) solutions at a faster rate. By integrating structure into operators, instead of fitness, these genetic operators could be beneficial to QD in PCGML."}
