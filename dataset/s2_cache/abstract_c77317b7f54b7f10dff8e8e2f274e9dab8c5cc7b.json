{"abstract":"Anomaly detection on attributed graphs has received increasing research attention lately due to the broad applications in various high-impact domains, such as cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare. Heretofore, most of the existing efforts are predominately performed in an unsupervised manner due to the expensive cost of acquiring anomaly labels, especially for newly formed domains. How to leverage the invaluable auxiliary information from a labeled attributed graph to facilitate the anomaly detection in the unlabeled attributed graph is seldom investigated. In this study, we aim to tackle the problem of cross-domain graph anomaly detection with domain adaptation. However, this task remains nontrivial mainly due to: 1) the data heterogeneity including both the topological structure and nodal attributes in an attributed graph and 2) the complexity of capturing both invariant and specific anomalies on the target domain graph. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework COMMANDER for cross-domain anomaly detection on attributed graphs. Specifically, COMMANDER first compresses the two attributed graphs from different domains to low-dimensional space via a graph attentive encoder. In addition, we utilize a domain discriminator and an anomaly classifier to detect anomalies that appear across networks from different domains. In order to further detect the anomalies that merely appear in the target network, we develop an attribute decoder to provide additional signals for assessing node abnormality. Extensive experiments on various real-world cross-domain graph datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach."}
