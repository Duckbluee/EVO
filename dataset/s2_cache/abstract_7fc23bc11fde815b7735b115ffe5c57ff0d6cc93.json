{"abstract":"Dataset expansion can effectively alleviate the problem of data scarcity for medical image segmentation, due to privacy concerns and labeling difficulties. However, existing expansion algorithms still face great challenges due to their inability of guaranteeing the diversity of synthesized images with paired segmentation masks. In recent years, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have shown powerful image synthesis performance, even better than Generative Adversarial Networks. Based on this insight, we propose an approach called DiffuseExpand for expanding datasets for 2D medical image segmentation using DPM, which first samples a variety of masks from Gaussian noise to ensure the diversity, and then synthesizes images to ensure the alignment of images and masks. After that, DiffuseExpand chooses high-quality samples to further enhance the effectiveness of data expansion. Our comparison and ablation experiments on COVID-19 and CGMH Pelvis datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffuseExpand. Our code is released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DiffuseExpand."}
