{"abstract":"Cluster computing for applications scientists is changing dramatically with the advent of commodity high performance processors, low-latency/high-bandwidth networks, and software infrastructure and development tools to facilitate the use of the cluster. The performance of an individual processor used in a high-end personal workstation rivals that of a processor in a high-end supercomputer, such as an SGI Origin, and the performance of the commodity processors is improving rapidly. For example, MIMD Lattice Computation (MILC) (Bernard et al.) executes at"}
