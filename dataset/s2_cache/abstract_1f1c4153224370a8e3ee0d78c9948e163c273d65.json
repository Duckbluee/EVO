{"abstract":"The performance of artificial intelligence (AI) for brain MRI can improve if enough data are made available. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) showed a lot of potential to generate synthetic MRI data that can capture the distribution of real MRI. Besides, GANs are also popular for segmentation, noise removal, and super-resolution of brain MRI images. This scoping review aims to explore how GANs methods are being used on brain MRI data, as reported in the literature. The review describes the different applications of GANs for brain MRI, presents the most commonly used GANs architectures, and summarizes the publicly available brain MRI datasets for advancing the research and development of GANs-based approaches. This review followed the guidelines of PRISMA-ScR to perform the study search and selection. The search was conducted on five popular scientific databases. The screening and selection of studies were performed by two independent reviewers, followed by validation by a third reviewer. Finally, the data were synthesized using a narrative approach. This review included 139 studies out of 789 search results. The most common use case of GANs was the synthesis of brain MRI images for data augmentation. GANs were also used to segment brain tumors and translate healthy images to diseased images or CT to MRI and vice versa. The included studies showed that GANs could enhance the performance of AI methods used on brain MRI imaging data. However, more efforts are needed to transform the GANs-based methods in clinical applications."}
