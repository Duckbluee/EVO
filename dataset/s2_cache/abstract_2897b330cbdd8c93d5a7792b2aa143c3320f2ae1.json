{"abstract":"Cryptographic algorithms implemented in hardware have to be resistant against many physical and side-channel analysis (SCA) attacks. Electromagnetic analysis attacks are based on the exploitation of measurable electromagnetic emanation of cryptographic chips. Detailed knowledge about electromagnetic radiation is necessary for the evaluation of the resistance of chips against the attacks during the early design phase, i.e. before the manufacturing and measurements. Therefore simulation of EM radiation of cryptographic chips is required. In this paper we discuss the possibility of simulation of electromagnetic traces for elliptic curve cryptography based on the publications we found regarding simulations of EM emanation of cryptographic integrated circuits."}
