{"abstract":"It has been more than 50 years since the initial investigation on automatic text summarization was started. Various techniques have been successfully used to extract the important contents from text document to represent document summary. In this study, we review some of the studies that have been conducted in this still-developing research area. It covers the basics of text summarization, the types of summarization, the methods that have been used and some areas in which text summarization has been applied. Furthermore, this paper also reviews the significant efforts which have been put in studies concerning sentence extraction, domain specific summarization and multi document summarization and provides the theoretical explanation and the fundamental concepts related to it. In addition, the advantages and limitations concerning the approaches commonly used for text summarization are also highlighted in this study."}
