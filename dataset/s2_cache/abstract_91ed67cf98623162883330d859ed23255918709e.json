{"abstract":"A large amount of log data is generated every moment in many real-world applications. System logs, mobile application logs, web logs etc., all of which contain rich information and can be analyzed for valuable information. At the same time, genealogy attracts more and more attention in recent decades, especially for Chinese. People utilize the genealogy system to seek roots, find source of family, build a family tree and so on. Due to the complexity of genealogy data and specific features of genealogy system, how to extract and analyze the valued genealogy information effectively is a huge challenge. Motivated by this, we propose a novel analysis method using web logs in genealogy system for drawing user profile and providing personalized recommendations. More specifically, firstly, all web logs are extracted from genealogy system based on the enhanced logs which record the behaviors and data of user. Secondly, the extracted logs are formatted for analysis, and we analyze the logs to extract various user-related attributes for drawing user profile. Finally, personalized recommendations like interested people and family tree are provided for each user in system. The high availability and effectiveness of our proposed method is verified on genealogy system-Huapu system."}
