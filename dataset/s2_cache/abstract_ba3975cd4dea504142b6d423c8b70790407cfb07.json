{"abstract":"One of the most crucial problem on training personalized response generation models for conversational robots is the lack of large scale personal conversation data. To address the problem, we propose a two-phase approach, namely initialization then adaptation, to first pre-train an optimized RNN encoder-decoder model (LTS model) in a large scale conversational data for general response generation and then fine-tune the model in a small scale personal conversation data to generate personalized responses. For evaluation, we propose a novel human aided method, which can be seen as a quasi-Turing test, to evaluate the performance of the personalized response generation models. Experimental results show that the proposed personalized response generation model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches to language model personalization and persona-based neural conversation generation on the automatic evaluation, offline human judgment and the quasi-Turing test."}
