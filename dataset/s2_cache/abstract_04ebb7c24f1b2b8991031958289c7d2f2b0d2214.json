{"abstract":"Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) has been extensively studied over the past decade, leading to the development of advanced algorithms. However, there has been a lack of research investigating how existing algorithms should be benchmarked with complex language queries, which include more informative descriptions of surrounding objects and backgrounds (e.g., the black car vs. the black car is parking on the road and beside the bus). Given the significant improvement in the semantic understanding capability of large pre-trained models, it is crucial to take a step further in RIS by incorporating complex language that resembles real-world applications. To close this gap, building upon the existing RefCOCO and Visual Genome datasets, we propose a new RIS benchmark with complex queries, namely RIS-CQ. The RIS-CQ dataset is of high quality and large scale, which challenges the existing RIS with enriched, specific, and informative queries, and enables a more realistic scenario of RIS research. Besides, we present a niche targeting method to better task the RIS-CQ, called Dual-Modality Graph Alignment (DuMoGa) model, which outperforms a series of RIS methods. To provide a valuable foundation for future advancements in the field of RIS with complex queries, we release the datasets, pre-processing and synthetic scripts, and the algorithm implementations at https://github.com/lili0415/DuMoGa."}
