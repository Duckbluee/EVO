{"abstract":"Depression is a serious and common psychiatric disease characterized by emotional and cognitive dysfunction. In addition, the rates of clinical diagnosis and treatment for depression are low. Therefore, the accurate recognition of depression is important for its effective treatment. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which can objectively reflect the inner states of human brains, are regarded as promising physiological tools that can enable effective and efficient clinical depression diagnosis and recognition. However, one of the challenges regarding EEG-based depression recognition involves sufficiently optimizing the spatial information derived from the multichannel space of EEG signals. Consequently, we propose an adaptive channel fusion method via improved focal loss (FL) functions for depression recognition based on EEG signals to effectively address this challenge. In this method, we propose two improved FL functions that can enhance the separability of hard examples by upweighting their losses as optimization objectives and can optimize the channel weights by a proposed adaptive channel fusion framework. The experimental results obtained on two EEG datasets show that the developed channel fusion method can achieve improved classification performance. The learned channel weights include the individual characteristics of each EEG epoch, which can effectively optimize the spatial information of each EEG epoch via the channel fusion method. In addition, the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art channel fusion methods."}
