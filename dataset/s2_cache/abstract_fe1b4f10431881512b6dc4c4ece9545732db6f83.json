{"abstract":"The fact that video annotation is labor-intensive inspires recent research to endeavor on few-shot video classification. The core motivation of our work is to mitigate the supervision scarcity issue in this few-shot setting via cross-domain meta-learning. Particularly, we aim to harness large-scale richly-annotated image data (i.e., source domain) for few-shot video classification (i.e., target domain). The source data is heterogeneous (image v.s. video) and has noisy labels, not directly usable in the target domain. This work proposes meta-learning input-transformer (MLIT), a novel deep network that tames the noisy source data such that they are more amenable for being used in the target domain. It has two key traits. First, to bridge the data distribution gap between source / target domains, MLIT includes learnable neural layers to reweigh and transform the source data, effectively suppressing corrupted or noisy source data. Secondly, MLIT is designed to learn from historic video classification tasks in the target domain, which significantly elevates the accuracy of the unseen video category. Comprehensive empirical evaluations on two large-scale video datasets, ActivityNet and Kinetics-400, have strongly shown the superiority of our proposed method."}
