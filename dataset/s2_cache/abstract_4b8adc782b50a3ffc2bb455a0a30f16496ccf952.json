{"abstract":"Mathematical error detection in educational settings presents a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), requiring a sophisticated understanding of both visual and textual mathematical content along with complex reasoning capabilities. Though effective in mathematical problem-solving, MLLMs often struggle with the nuanced task of identifying and categorizing student errors in multimodal mathematical contexts. Therefore, we introduce MathAgent, a novel Mixture-of-Math-Agent framework designed specifically to address these challenges. Our approach decomposes error detection into three phases, each handled by a specialized agent: an image-text consistency validator, a visual semantic interpreter, and an integrative error analyzer. This architecture enables more accurate processing of mathematical content by explicitly modeling relationships between multimodal problems and student solution steps. We evaluate MathAgent on real-world educational data, demonstrating approximately 5% higher accuracy in error step identification and 3% improvement in error categorization compared to baseline models. Besides, MathAgent has been successfully deployed in an educational platform that has served over one million K-12 students, achieving nearly 90% student satisfaction while generating significant cost savings by reducing manual error detection."}
