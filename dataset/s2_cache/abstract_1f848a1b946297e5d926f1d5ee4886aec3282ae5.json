{"abstract":"We apply facial recognition methods to FOMC press conference videos, and quantify one of the most important aspects of nonverbal communication - facial expressions. Using minute-level data, we align our nonverbal communication measure with a set of financial assets to estimate the impact of the Federal Reserve Chairs' facial expressions on investor expectations. We find that investors adversely react to negative expression revealed during the press conference, even when controlling for the verbal component of the press conference and additional explanatory variables. The effect is heightened in meetings that draw more attention and when the Chair is discussing forward guidance."}
