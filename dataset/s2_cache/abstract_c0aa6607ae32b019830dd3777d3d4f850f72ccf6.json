{"abstract":"Deep transfer learning (DTL), which incorporates new ideas from deep neural networks into transfer learning (TL), has achieved excellent success in computer vision, text classification, behavior recognition, and natural language processing. As a branch of machine learning, DTL applies end-to-end learning to overcome the drawback of traditional machine learning that regards each dataset individually. Although some valuable and impressive general surveys exist on TL, special attention and recent advances in DTL are lacking. In this survey, we first review more than 50 representative approaches of DTL in the last decade and systematically summarize them into four categories. In particular, we further divide each category into subcategories according to models, functions, and operation objects. In addition, we discuss recent advances in TL in other fields and unsupervised TL. Finally, we provide some possible and exciting future research directions."}
