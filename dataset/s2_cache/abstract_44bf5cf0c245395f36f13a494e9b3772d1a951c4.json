{"abstract":"We present <italic>Interactive Gibson Benchmark</italic>, the first comprehensive benchmark for training and evaluating <italic>Interactive Navigation</italic> solutions. Interactive Navigation tasks are robot navigation problems where physical interaction with objects (e.g., pushing) is allowed and even encouraged to reach the goal. Our benchmark comprises two novel elements: 1) a new experimental simulated environment, the <italic>Interactive Gibson Environment</italic>, that generate photo-realistic images of indoor scenes and simulates realistic physical interactions of robots and common objects found in these scenes; 2) the <italic>Interactive Navigation Score</italic>, a novel metric to study the interplay between navigation and physical interaction of Interactive Navigation solutions. We present and evaluate multiple learning-based baselines in Interactive Gibson Benchmark, and provide insights into regimes of navigation with different trade-offs between navigation, path efficiency and disturbance of surrounding objects. We make our benchmark publicly available<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"fn1\"><sup>1</sup></xref><fn id=\"fn1\"><label><sup>1</sup></label><p>[Online].
