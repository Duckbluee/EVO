{"abstract":"The pre-trained model (PTM) is revolutionizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. However, the hardware requirement of PTM training is prohibitively high, making it a game for a small proportion of people. Therefore, we proposed PatrickStar system to lower the hardware requirements of PTMs and make them accessible to everyone. PatrickStar uses the CPU-GPU heterogeneous memory space to store the model data. Different from existing works, we organize the model data in memory chunks and dynamically distribute them in the heterogeneous memory. Guided by the runtime memory statistics collected in a warm-up iteration, chunks are orchestrated efficiently in heterogeneous memory and generate lower CPU-GPU data transmission volume and higher bandwidth utilization. Symbiosis with the Zero Redundancy Optimizer, PatrickStar scales to multiple GPUs on multiple nodes. The system can train tasks on bigger models and larger batch sizes, which cannot be accomplished by existing works. Experimental results show that PatrickStar extends model scales 2.27 and 2.5 times of DeepSpeed, and exhibits significantly higher execution speed. PatricStar also successfully runs the 175B GPT3 training task on a 32 GPU cluster. Our code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/PatrickStar."}
