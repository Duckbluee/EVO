{"abstract":"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) stands at the forefront of AI innovation, demonstrating rapid advancement and unparalleled proficiency in generating diverse content. Beyond content creation, GAI has significant analytical abilities to learn complex data distribution, offering numerous opportunities to resolve security issues. In the realm of security from physical layer perspectives, traditional AI approaches frequently struggle, primarily due to their limited capacity to dynamically adjust to the evolving physical attributes of transmission channels and the complexity of contemporary cyber threats. This adaptability and analytical depth are precisely where GAI excels. Therefore, in this paper, we offer an extensive survey on the various applications of GAI in enhancing security within the physical layer of communication networks. We first emphasize the importance of advanced GAI models in this area, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Autoencoders (AEs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). We delve into the roles of GAI in addressing challenges of physical layer security, focusing on communication confidentiality, authentication, availability, resilience, and integrity. Furthermore, we also present future research directions focusing model improvements, multi-scenario deployment, resource-efficient optimization, and secure semantic communication, highlighting the multifaceted potential of GAI to address emerging challenges in secure physical layer communications and sensing."}
