{"abstract":"We consider the problem of downlink power control in wireless networks, consisting of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs communicating with each other over a single shared wireless medium. To mitigate the interference among concurrent transmissions, we leverage the network topology to create a graph neural network architecture, and we then use an unsupervised primal-dual counterfactual optimization approach to learn optimal power allocation decisions. We show how the counterfactual optimization technique allows us to guarantee a minimum rate constraint, which adapts to the network size, hence achieving the right balance between average and 5th percentile user rates throughout a range of network configurations."}
