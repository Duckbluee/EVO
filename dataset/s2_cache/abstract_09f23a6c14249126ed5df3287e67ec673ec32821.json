{"abstract":"A dual-band sensor based on a planar rectangular cavity loaded with pairs of improved planar resonator is used to measure the permittivity difference of liquids with a small volume ( $2.5~\\mu \\text{l}$ ). The planar cavity is connected by two microstrip transmission lines, constituting a two-port device with two branches. A pair of interdigital capacitor (IDC)-based split ring resonator (SRR) is coupled to the middle part of each branch. The distance between the IDC–SRRs is large, and their coupling can be neglected. Thus, two resonance frequencies are produced (4.15 and 9.18 GHz). One frequency is generated from the resonance of the two IDC-based SRRs (4.15 GHz), whereas the other results from the coupling of the rectangular cavity and the two IDC-based SRRs (9.18 GHz). Frequency splitting is used to detect changes in the dielectric characteristics of the liquids. If the two branches (IDC-based SRRs) of the proposed sensor are placed on the same liquid, only two resonance frequencies are obtained. When two different liquids are loaded by the sensor, the resonance frequency will be split into four. A planar rectangular cavity is used instead of a splitter configuration to motivate the two IDC–SRRs. This novel design affords a dual-band miniaturized sensor."}
