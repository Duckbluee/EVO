{"abstract":"Citation recommendation is a technique that assists an academic publisher or scholar in identifying a selection of relevant works that can be cited while writing a paper. In comparison to prior years, it is clear that there is currently a deluge of articles being published every year. Each year, more than 50,000 publications in the field of artificial intelligence are published. As a result, the traditional way of identifying valid citations appears to be a very difficult process, as there appears to be a massive flow of data. Traditional recommendation systems, despite their prevalence, are ineffective and time-consuming. So far, several techniques to tackle this problem have been offered.In this study, we will look at a range of citation recommendation systems that have been developed so far, as well as their future potential."}
