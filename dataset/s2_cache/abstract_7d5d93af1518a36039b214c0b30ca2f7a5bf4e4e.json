{"abstract":"The data volume of in silico drug discovery studies is often small. Therefore, the availability of labeled data is a major limitation in artificial intelligence-assisted drug discovery. One solution to the problem is to develop algorithms that can cope with relatively heterogeneous and scarce data. Transfer learning is a kind of machine learning that can leverage existing knowledge from other related tasks to a specific task with insufficient data. Deep transfer learning is the most commonly used method and has attained much progress in the field of drug discovery. This perspective aims to provide an overview of transfer learning and related applications in drug discovery and give outlooks as to future development and application of transfer learning for drug discovery."}
