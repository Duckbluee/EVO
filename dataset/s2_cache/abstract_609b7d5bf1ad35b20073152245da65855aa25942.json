{"abstract":"Tooth segmentation is a pivotal step in modern digital dentistry, essential for applications across orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite its importance, this process is fraught with challenges due to the high noise and low contrast inherent in 2D and 3D tooth data. Both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers has shown promise in medical image segmentation, yet each method has limitations in handling long-range dependencies and computational complexity. To address this issue, this paper introduces T-Mamba, integrating frequency-based features and shared bi-positional encoding into vision mamba to address limitations in efficient global feature modeling. Besides, we design a gate selection unit to integrate two features in spatial domain and one feature in frequency domain adaptively. T-Mamba is the first work to introduce frequency-based features into vision mamba, and its flexibility allows it to process both 2D and 3D tooth data without the need for separate modules. Also, the TED3, a large-scale public tooth 2D dental X-ray dataset, has been presented in this paper. Extensive experiments demonstrate that T-Mamba achieves new SOTA results on a public tooth CBCT dataset and outperforms previous SOTA methods on TED3 dataset.
