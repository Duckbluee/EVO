{"abstract":"The Java Modeling Language (JML) can be used to specify the detailed design of Java classes and interfaces by adding annotations to Java source files. The aim of JML is to provide a specification language that is easy to use for Java programmers and that is supported by a wide range of tools for specification typechecking, runtime debugging, static analysis, and verification.This paper gives an overview of the main ideas behind JML, details about JML’s wide range of tools, and a glimpse into existing applications of JML."}
