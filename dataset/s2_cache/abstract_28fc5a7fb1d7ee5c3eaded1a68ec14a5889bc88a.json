{"abstract":"We propose a classical simulation method for quantum circuits based on decomposing unitary gates into a sum of stabilizer projectors. By only decomposing the non-Clifford gates, we take advantage of the Gottesman-Knill theorem and build a bridge between stabilizer-based simulation and Feynman-path-type simulation. We give two variants of this method: stabilizer-based path-integral recursion (SPIR) and stabilizer projector contraction (SPC). We also analyze further advantages and disadvantages of our method compared to the Bravyi-Gosset algorithm and recursive Feynman path-integral algorithms. We construct a parametrized circuit ensemble and identify the parameter regime in this ensemble where our method offers superior performance. We also estimate the time cost for simulating quantum supremacy experiments with our method and motivate potential improvements of the method."}
