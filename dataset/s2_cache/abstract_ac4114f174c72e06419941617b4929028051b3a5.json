{"abstract":"Pre-trained large multi-modal models (LMMs) exploit fine-tuning to adapt diverse user applications. Nevertheless, fine-tuning may face challenges due to deactivated sensors (e.g., cameras turned off for privacy or technical issues), yielding modality-incomplete data and leading to inconsistency in training data and the data for inference. Additionally, continuous training leads to catastrophic forgetting, diluting the knowledge in pre-trained LMMs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel task, Continual Missing Modality Learning (CMML), to investigate how models can generalize when data of certain modalities is missing during continual fine-tuning. Our preliminary benchmarks reveal that existing methods suffer from a significant performance drop in CMML, even with the aid of advanced continual learning techniques. Therefore, we devise a framework termed Reconstruct before Query (RebQ). It decomposes prompts into modality-specific ones and breaks them into components stored in pools accessible via a key-query mechanism, which facilitates ParameterEfficient Fine-Tuning and enhances knowledge transferability for subsequent tasks. Meanwhile, our RebQ leverages extensive multi-modal knowledge from pre-trained LMMs to reconstruct the data of missing modality. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RebQ effectively reconstructs the missing modality information and retains pre-trained knowledge. Specifically, compared with the baseline, RebQ improves average precision from 20.00 to 50.92 and decreases average forgetting from 75.95 to 8.56.
