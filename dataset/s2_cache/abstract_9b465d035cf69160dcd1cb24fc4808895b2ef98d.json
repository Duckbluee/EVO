{"abstract":"Researchers are starting to design AI-powered systems to automatically select and summarize the reports most relevant to each analyst, which raises the issue of bias in the information presented. This article focuses on the selection of relevant reports without an explicit query, a task known as recommendation. Drawing on previous work documenting the existence of human-machine feedback loops in recommender systems, this article reviews potential biases and mitigations in the context of intelligence analysis. Such loops can arise when behavioral “engagement” signals such as clicks or user ratings are used to infer the value of displayed information. Even worse, there can be feedback loops in the collection of intelligence information because users may also be responsible for tasking collection. Avoiding misalignment feedback loops requires an alternate, ongoing, non-engagement signal of information quality. Existing evaluation scales for intelligence product quality and rigor, such as the IC Rating Scale, could provide ground-truth feedback. This sparse data can be used in two ways: for human supervision of average performance and to build models that predict human survey ratings for use at recommendation time. Both techniques are widely used today by social media platforms. Open problems include the design of an ideal human evaluation method, the cost of skilled human labor, and the sparsity of the resulting data."}
