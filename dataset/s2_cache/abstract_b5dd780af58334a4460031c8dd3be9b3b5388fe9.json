{"abstract":"This study evaluated the effect of change in background on steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) and steady state motion visually evoked potentials (SSMVEP) based brain computer interfaces (BCI) in a small-profile augmented reality (AR) headset. A four target SSVEP and SSMVEP BCI was implemented using the Cognixion AR headset prototype. An active (AB) and a non-active background (NB) were evaluated. The signal characteristics and classification performance of the two BCI paradigms were studied. Offline analysis was performed using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and complex-spectrum based convolutional neural network (C-CNN). Finally, the asynchronous pseudo-online performance of the SSMVEP BCI was evaluated. Signal analysis revealed that the SSMVEP stimulus was more robust to change in background compared to SSVEP stimulus in AR. The decoding performance revealed that the C-CNN method outperformed CCA for both stimulus types and NB background, in agreement with results in the literature. The average offline accuracies for W = 1 s of C-CNN were (NB vs. AB): SSVEP: 82% ±15% vs. 60% ±21% and SSMVEP: 71.4% ± 22% vs. 63.5% ± 18%. Additionally, for W = 2 s, the AR-SSMVEP BCI with the C-CNN method was 83.3% ± 27% (NB) and 74.1% ±22% (AB). The results suggest that with the C-CNN method, the AR-SSMVEP BCI is both robust to change in background conditions and provides high decoding accuracy compared to the AR-SSVEP BCI. This study presents novel results that highlight the robustness and practical application of SSMVEP BCIs developed with a low-cost AR headset."}
