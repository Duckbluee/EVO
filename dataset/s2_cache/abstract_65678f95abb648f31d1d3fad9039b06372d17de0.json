{"abstract":"One of the ways to analyze unstructured log messages from large-scale IT systems is to classify log messages with log templates generated by template generation methods. However, there is currently no shared knowledge pertained to the comparison and practical use of log template generation methods because they are implemented on the basis of diverse environments. To this end, we design and implement amulog, a general log analysis framework for diverse log template generation methods. There are three key functions of amulog: (1) parsing log messages into headers and segmented messages, (2) classifying the log messages using a scalable template-matching method, and (3) storing the structured data in a database. This framework helps us easily utilize time-series data corresponding to the log templates for further analysis. We evaluate amulog with a log dataset collected from a nation-wide academic network and demonstrate that it works in a reasonable amount of time even with over 100,000 log template candidates."}
