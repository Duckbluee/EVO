{"abstract":"Within the field of computer vision, image segmentation and classification serve as crucial tasks, involving the automatic categorization of images into predefined groups or classes, respectively. In this work, we propose a framework designed for simultaneously addressing segmentation and classification tasks in image-processing contexts. The proposed framework is composed of three main modules and focuses on providing transparency, interpretability, and explainability in its operations. The first two modules are used to partition the input image into regions of interest, allowing the automatic and interpretable identification of segmentation regions using clustering techniques. These segmentation regions are then analyzed to select those considered valuable by the user for addressing the classification task. The third module focuses on classification, using an explainable classifier, which relies on hand-crafted transparent features extracted from the selected segmentation regions. By leveraging only the selected informative regions, the classification model is made more reliable and less susceptible to misleading information. The proposed framework’s effectiveness was evaluated in a case study on skin-cancer-segmentation and -classification benchmarks. The experimental analysis highlighted that the proposed framework exhibited comparable performance with the state-of-the-art deep-learning approaches, which implies its efficiency, considering the fact that the proposed approach is also interpretable and explainable."}
