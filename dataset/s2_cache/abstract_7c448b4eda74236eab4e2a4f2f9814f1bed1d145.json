{"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a simple and general framework for self-supervised point cloud representation learning. Human beings understand the 3D world by extracting two levels of information and establishing the relationship between them. One is the global shape of an object, and the other is the local structures of it. However, few existing studies in point cloud representation learning explored how to learn both global shapes and local-to-global relationships without a specified network architecture. Inspired by how human beings understand the world, we utilize knowledge distillation to learn both global shape information and the relationship between global shape and local structures. At the same time, we combine contrastive learning with knowledge distillation to make the teacher network be better updated. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on linear classification and multiple other downstream tasks. Especially, we develop a variant of ViT for 3D point cloud feature extraction, which also achieves comparable results with existing backbones when combined with our framework, and visualization of the attention maps show that our model does understand the point cloud by combining the global shape information and multiple local structural information, which is consistent with the inspiration of our representation learning method. Our code will be released soon."}
