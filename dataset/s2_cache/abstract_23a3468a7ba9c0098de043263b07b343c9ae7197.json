{"abstract":"Engagement detection is essential in many areas such as driver attention tracking, employee engagement monitoring, and student engagement evaluation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using attention based hybrid deep models for the 8th Emotion Recognition in the Wild (EmotiW 2020) Grand Challenge in the category of engagement prediction in the wild EMOTIW2020. The task aims to predict the engagement intensity of subjects in videos, and the subjects are students watching educational videos from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). To complete the task, we propose a hybrid deep model based on multi-rate and multi-instance attention. The novelty of the proposed model can be summarized in three aspects: (a) an attention based Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) deep network, (b) heuristic multi-rate processing on video based data, and (c) a rigorous and accurate ensemble model. Experimental results on the validation set and test set show that our method makes promising improvements, achieving a competitively low MSE of 0.0541 on the test set, improving on the baseline results by 64%. The proposed model won the first place in the engagement prediction in the wild challenge."}
