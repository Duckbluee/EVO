{"abstract":"In this paper we analyze features to classify human- and AI-generated text for English, French, German and Spanish and compare them across languages. We investigate two scenarios: (1) The detection of text generated by AI from scratch, and (2) the detection of text rephrased by AI. For training and testing the classifiers in this multilingual setting, we created a new text corpus covering 10 topics for each language. For the detection of AI-generated text, the combination of all proposed features performs best, indicating that our features are portable to other related languages: The F1-scores are close with 99% for Spanish, 98% for English, 97% for German and 95% for French. For the detection of AI-rephrased text, the systems with all features outperform systems with other features in many cases, but using only document features performs best for German (72%) and Spanish (86%) and only text vector features leads to best results for English (78%)."}
