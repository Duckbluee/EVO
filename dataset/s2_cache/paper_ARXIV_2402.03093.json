Virtual Reality (VR) technology, aided by artificial intelligence (AI), has emerged as a dominant interaction media in multiple application areas, thanks to its advantage of providing users with immersive experiences. Among those applications, medicine is considered one of the most promising areas. In this paper, we present a comprehensive examination of the burgeoning field of AI-enhanced VR applications in medical care and services. By introducing a systematic taxonomy, we meticulously classify the pertinent techniques and applications into three well-defined categories based on different phases of medical diagnosis and treatment: Visualization Enhancement, VR-related Medical Data Processing, and VR-assisted Intervention. This categorization enables a structured exploration of the diverse roles that AI-powered VR plays in the medical domain, providing a framework for a more comprehensive understanding and evaluation of these technologies.nTo our best knowledge, this work is the first systematic survey of AI-powered VR systems in medical settings, laying a foundation for future research in this interdisciplinary domain."}
