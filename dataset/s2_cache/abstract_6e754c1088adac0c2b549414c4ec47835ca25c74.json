{"abstract":"The promise of quantum computing is not speeding up conventional computing rather delivering an exponential advantage for certain classes of problems, with profound implications for cybersecurity for instance. With the advent and development of quantum computers, cyberspace security can surely become the most critical problem for the Internet in near future. On contrary, prosaic quantum technology can be promising to transform cybersecurity. This research aims to synthesize basic and fundamental studies concerning quantum cybersecurity that can be emerged both as a threat and solution to critical cybersecurity issues based on a systematic study. We provide a comprehensive, illustrative description of the current state-of-the-art quantum computing and cybersecurity and present the proposed approaches to date. Findings in quantum computing cybersecurity suggest that quantum computing can be adopted for the betterment of cybersecurity threats while it poses the most unexpected threats to cybersecurity. The focus and depth of this systematic survey not only provide quantum and cybersecurity practitioners and researchers with a consolidated body of knowledge about current trends in this area but also underpins a starting point for further research in this field."}
