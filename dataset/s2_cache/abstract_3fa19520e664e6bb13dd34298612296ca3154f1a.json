{"abstract":"ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot platform that enables human users to converse with machines. It utilizes natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, transforming how people interact with AI technology. ChatGPT offers significant advantages over previous similar tools, and its potential for application in various fields has generated attention and anticipation. However, some experts are wary of ChatGPT, citing ethical implications. Therefore, this paper shows that ChatGPT has significant potential to transform marketing and shape its future if certain ethical considerations are taken into account. First, we argue that ChatGPT-based tools can help marketers create content faster and potentially with quality similar to human content creators. It can also assist marketers in conducting more efficient research and understanding customers better, automating customer service, and improving efficiency. Then we discuss ethical implications and potential risks for marketers, consumers, and other stakeholders, that are essential for ChatGPT-based marketing; doing so can help revolutionize marketing while avoiding potential harm to stakeholders."}
