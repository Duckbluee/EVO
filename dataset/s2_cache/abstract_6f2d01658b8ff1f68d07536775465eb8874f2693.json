{"abstract":"Despite Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) showing compelling results in photorealistic novel views synthesis of real-world scenes, most existing approaches require accurate prior camera poses. Although approaches for jointly recovering the radiance field and camera pose exist (BARF), they rely on a cumbersome coarse-to-fine auxiliary positional embedding to ensure good performance. We present Gaussian Activated neural Radiance Fields (GARF), a new positional embedding-free neural radiance field architecture - employing Gaussian activations - that outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of high fidelity reconstruction and pose estimation."}
