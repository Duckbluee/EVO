The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has observed various techniques, including saliency-based and concept-based approaches. These approaches explain the model's decisions in simple human understandable terms called Concepts. Concepts are known to be the thinking ground of humans}. Explanations in terms of concepts enable detecting spurious correlations, inherent biases, or clever-hans. With the advent of concept-based explanations, a range of concept representation methods and automatic concept discovery algorithms have been introduced. Some recent works also use concepts for model improvement in terms of interpretability and generalization. We provide a systematic review and taxonomy of various concept representations and their discovery algorithms in DNNs, specifically in vision. We also provide details on concept-based model improvement literature marking the first comprehensive survey of these methods."}
