{"abstract":"Graph neural networks (GNN) are a powerful tool for combining imaging and non-imaging medical information for node classification tasks. Cross-network node classification extends GNN techniques to account for domain drift, allowing for node classification on an unlabeled target network. In this paper we present OTGCN, a powerful, novel approach to cross-network node classification. This approach leans on concepts from graph convolutional networks to harness insights from graph data structures while simultaneously applying strategies rooted in optimal transport to correct for the domain drift that can occur between samples from different data collection sites. This blended approach provides a practical solution for scenarios with many distinct forms of data collected across different locations and equipment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach at classifying Autism Spectrum Disorder subjects using a blend of imaging and non-imaging data."}
