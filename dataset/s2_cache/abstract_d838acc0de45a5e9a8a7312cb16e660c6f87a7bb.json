{"abstract":"Compared with flatbed scanners, portable smartphones provide more convenience for physical document digitization. However, such digitized documents are often distorted due to uncontrolled physical deformations, camera positions, and illumination variations. To this end, we present DocScanner, a novel framework for document image rectification. Different from existing solutions, DocScanner addresses this issue by introducing a progressive learning mechanism. Specifically, DocScanner maintains a single estimate of the rectified image, which is progressively corrected with a recurrent architecture. The iterative refinements make DocScanner converge to a robust and superior rectification performance, while the lightweight recurrent architecture ensures the running efficiency. To further improve the rectification quality, based on the geometric priori between the distorted and the rectified images, a geometric constraint is introduced during training to further improve the performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Doc3D dataset and the DocUNet Benchmark dataset, and the quantitative and qualitative evaluation results verify the effectiveness of DocScanner, which outperforms previous methods on OCR accuracy, image similarity, and our proposed distortion metric by a considerable margin. Furthermore, our DocScanner shows superior efficiency in runtime latency and model size. The codes and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/fh2019ustc/DocScanner."}
