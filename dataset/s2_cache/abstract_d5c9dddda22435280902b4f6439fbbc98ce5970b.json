{"abstract":"To obtain accurate predictions of classifiers, model ensembles comprising multiple trained machine learning models are nowadays used. In particular, dynamic model ensembles pick the most accurate model for each query object, by applying the model that performed best on similar data. Dynamic model ensembles may however suffer, similarly to single machine learning models, from bias, which can eventually lead to unfair treatment of certain groups of a general population. To mitigate unfair classification, recent work has thus proposed fair model ensembles, that instead of focusing (solely) on accuracy also optimize global fairness. While such global fairness globally minimizes bias, imbalances may persist in different regions of the data, e.g., caused by some local bias maxima leading to local unfairness. Therefore, we extend our previous work by including a framework that bridges the gap between dynamic model ensembles and fair model ensembles. More precisely, we investigate the problem of devising locally fair and accurate dynamic model ensembles, which ultimately optimize for equal opportunity of similar subjects. We propose a general framework to perform this task and present several algorithms implementing the framework components. In this paper we also present a runtime-efficient framework adaptation that keeps the quality of the results on a similar level. Furthermore, new fairness metrics are presented as well as detailed informations about necessary data preparations. Our evaluation of the framework implementations and metrics shows that our approach outperforms the state-of-the art for different types and degrees of bias present in training data in terms of both local and global fairness, while reaching comparable accuracy."}
