{"abstract":"We discuss text summarization in terms of maximum coverage problem and its variant. We explore some decoding algorithms including the ones never used in this summarization formulation, such as a greedy algorithm with performance guarantee, a randomized algorithm, and a branch-and-bound method. On the basis of the results of comparative experiments, we also augment the summarization model so that it takes into account the relevance to the document cluster. Through experiments, we showed that the augmented model is superior to the best-performing method of DUC'04 on ROUGE-1 without stopwords."}
