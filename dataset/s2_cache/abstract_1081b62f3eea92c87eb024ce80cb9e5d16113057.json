{"abstract":"How can we enhance the node features acquired from Pretrained Models (PMs) to better suit downstream graph learning tasks? Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art approach for many high-impact, real-world graph applications. For feature-rich graphs, a prevalent practice involves directly utilizing a PM to generate features. Nevertheless, this practice is suboptimal as the node features extracted from PMs are graph-agnostic and prevent GNNs from fully utilizing the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features, leading to a decline in GNN performance. In this work, we seek to improve the node features obtained from a PM for graph tasks and introduce TouchUp-G, a \"Detect & Correct\" approach for refining node features extracted from PMs. TouchUp-G detects the alignment using a novel feature homophily metric and corrects the misalignment through a simple touchup on the PM. It is (a) General: applicable to any downstream graph task; (b) Multi-modal: able to improve raw features of any modality; (c) Principled: it is closely related to a novel metric, feature homophily, which we propose to quantify the alignment between the graph structure and node features; (d) Effective: achieving state-of-the-art results on four real-world datasets spanning different tasks and modalities."}
