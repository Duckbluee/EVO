{"abstract":"Predicting human’s gaze from egocentric videos serves as a critical role for human intention understanding in daily activities. In this paper, we present the first transformer-based model to address the challenging problem of egocentric gaze estimation. We observe that the connection between the global scene context and local visual information is vital for localizing the gaze fixation from egocentric video frames. To this end, we design the transformer encoder to embed the global context as one additional visual token and further propose a novel global–local correlation module to explicitly model the correlation of the global token and each local token. We validate our model on two egocentric video datasets – EGTEA Gaze + and Ego4D. Our detailed ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of our method. In addition, our approach exceeds the previous state-of-the-art model by a large margin. We also apply our model to a novel gaze saccade/fixation prediction task and the traditional action recognition problem. The consistent gains suggest the strong generalization capability of our model. We also provide additional visualizations to support our claim that global–local correlation serves a key representation for predicting gaze fixation from egocentric videos.
