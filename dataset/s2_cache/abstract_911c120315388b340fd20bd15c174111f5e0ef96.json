{"abstract":"Data privacy and silos are nontrivial and greatly challenging in many real-world applications. Federated learning is a decentralized approach to training models across multiple local clients without the exchange of raw data from client devices to global servers. However, existing works focus on a static data environment and ignore continual learning from streaming data with incremental tasks. Federated Continual Learning (FCL) is an emerging paradigm to address model learning in both federated and continual learning environments. The key objective of FCL is to fuse heterogeneous knowledge from different clients and retain knowledge of previous tasks while learning on new ones. In this work, we delineate federated learning and continual learning first and then discuss their integration, i.e., FCL, and particular FCL via knowledge fusion. In summary, our motivations are four-fold: we (1) raise a fundamental problem called “spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting” and evaluate its impact on the performance using a well-known method called federated averaging (FedAvg), (2) integrate most of the existing FCL methods into two generic frameworks, namely synchronous FCL and asynchronous FCL, (3) categorize a large number of methods according to the mechanism involved in knowledge fusion, and finally (4) showcase an outlook on the future work of FCL."}
