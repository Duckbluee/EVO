{"abstract":"Source free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to transfer a trained source model to the unlabeled target domain without accessing the source data. However, the SFDA setting faces an effect bottleneck due to the absence of source data and target supervised information, as evidenced by the limited performance gains of newest SFDA methods. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce a more practical scenario called active source free domain adaptation (ASFDA) that permits actively selecting a few target data to be labeled by experts. To achieve that, we first find that those satisfying the properties of neighbor-chaotic, individual-different, and target-like are the best points to select, and we define them as the minimum happy (MH) points. We then propose minimum happy points learning (MHPL) to actively explore and exploit MH points. We design three unique strategies: neighbor ambient uncertainty, neighbor diversity relaxation, and one-shot querying, to explore the MH points. Further, to fully exploit MH points in the learning process, we design a neighbor focal loss that assigns the weighted neighbor purity to the cross-entropy loss of MH points to make the model focus more on them. Extensive experiments verify that MHPL remarkably exceeds the various types of baselines and achieves significant performance gains at a small cost of labeling."}
