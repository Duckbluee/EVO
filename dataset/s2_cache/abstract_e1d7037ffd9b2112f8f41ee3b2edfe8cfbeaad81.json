{"abstract":"The force modulation of robotic manipulators has been extensively studied for several decades. However, it is not yet commonly used in safety-critical applications due to a lack of accurate interaction contact modeling and weak performance guarantees—a large proportion of them concerning the modulation of interaction forces. This study presents a high-level framework for simultaneous trajectory optimization and force control of the interaction between a manipulator and soft environments, which is prone to external disturbances. Sliding friction and normal contact force are taken into account. The dynamics of the soft contact model and the manipulator are simultaneously incorporated in a trajectory optimizer to generate desired motion and force profiles. A constrained optimization framework based on the alternative direction method of multipliers has been employed to efficiently generate real-time optimal control inputs and high-dimensional state trajectories in a model-predictive control fashion. The experimental validation of the model performance is conducted on a soft substrate with known material properties using a Cartesian space force control mode. Results show a comparison of ground truth and real-time model-based contact force and motion tracking for multiple Cartesian motions in the valid range of the friction model. It is shown that a contact-model-based motion planner can compensate for frictional forces and motion disturbances and improve the overall motion and force tracking accuracy. The proposed high-level planner has the potential to facilitate the automation of medical tasks involving the manipulation of compliant, delicate, and deformable tissues."}
