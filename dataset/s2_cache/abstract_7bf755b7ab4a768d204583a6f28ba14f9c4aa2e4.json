{"abstract":"Abstract An intelligent autonomous robot is required in various applications such as space, transportation, industry, and defense. Mobile robots can also perform several tasks like material handling, disaster relief, patrolling, and rescue operation. Therefore, an autonomous robot is required that can travel freely in a static or a dynamic environment. Smooth and safe navigation of mobile robot through cluttered environment from start position to goal position with following safe path and producing optimal path length is the main aim of mobile robot navigation. Regarding this matter, several techniques have been explored by researchers for robot navigation path planning. An effort has been made in this article to study several navigation techniques, which are well suited for the static and dynamic environment and can be implemented for real-time navigation of mobile robot."}
