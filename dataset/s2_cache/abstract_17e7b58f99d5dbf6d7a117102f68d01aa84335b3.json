{"abstract":"This paper addresses the contentious issue of copyright infringement in images generated by text-to-image models, sparking debates among AI developers, content creators, and legal entities. State-of-the-art models create high-quality content without crediting original creators, causing concern in the artistic community. To mitigate this, we propose the \\copyright Plug-in Authorization framework, introducing three operations: addition, extraction, and combination. Addition involves training a \\copyright plug-in for specific copyright, facilitating proper credit attribution. Extraction allows creators to reclaim copyright from infringing models, and combination enables users to merge different \\copyright plug-ins. These operations act as permits, incentivizing fair use and providing flexibility in authorization. We present innovative approaches,\"Reverse LoRA\"for extraction and\"EasyMerge\"for seamless combination. Experiments in artist-style replication and cartoon IP recreation demonstrate \\copyright plug-ins' effectiveness, offering a valuable solution for human copyright protection in the age of generative AIs.
