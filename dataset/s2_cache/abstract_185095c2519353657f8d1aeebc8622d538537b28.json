{"abstract":"Open-world novelty occurs when the rules of an environment can change abruptly, such as when a game player encounters\"house rules\". To address open-world novelty, game playing agents must be able to detect when novelty is injected, and to quickly adapt to the new rules. We propose a model-based reinforcement learning approach where game state and rules are represented as knowledge graphs. The knowledge graph representation of the state and rules allows novelty to be detected as changes in the knowledge graph, assists with the training of deep reinforcement learners, and enables imagination-based re-training where the agent uses the knowledge graph to perform look-ahead."}
