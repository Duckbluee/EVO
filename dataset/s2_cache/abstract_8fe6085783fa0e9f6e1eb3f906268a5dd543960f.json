{"abstract":"This article considers the problem of containment control in an adversarial environment, where some of the agents might be misbehaving (or faulty). Despite the influence of network misbehaviors, the normal followers aim to move into the convex hull spanned by the normal leaders. Toward this goal, resilient containment control is investigated in this work. We propose secure protocols for both first-order and second-order systems, where each normal follower ignores the most extreme values in its neighborhood and modifies its state based on the remaining ones. Assuming that the number of malicious agents is locally upper bounded, sufficient conditions on the network topology are derived to guarantee the achievement of resilient containment. Numerical examples are also provided in the end to verify our theoretical results."}
