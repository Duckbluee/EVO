{"abstract":"In this article, we propose a trustworthy privacy-preserving federated learning (FL)-based deep learning (DL) service framework for Industrial Internet of Things-enabled systems. FL mitigates the privacy issues of the traditional collaborative learning model by aggregating multiple locally trained models without sharing any datasets among the participants. Nevertheless, the FL-based DL (FDL) model cannot be trusted as it is susceptible to intermediate results and data structure leakage during the model aggregation process. The proposed framework introduces an edge and cloud-powered service-oriented architecture identifying the key components and a service model for residual networks-based FDL with differential privacy for generating trustworthy locally trained models. The service model decomposes the functionality of the overall FDL process as services to ensure trustworthy execution through privacy preservation. Finally, we develop a privacy-preserving local model aggregation mechanism for FDL. We perform several experiments to assess the performance of the proposed framework."}
