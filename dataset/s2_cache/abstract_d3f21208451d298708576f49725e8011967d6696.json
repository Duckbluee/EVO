{"abstract":"We investigate the basic principles of structural knowledge. Structural knowledge underlies cognition, and it organizes, selects and assigns meaning to information. It is the result of evolutionary, cultural and developmental processes. Because of its own constraints, it needs to discover and exploit regularities and thereby achieve a complexity reduction."}
