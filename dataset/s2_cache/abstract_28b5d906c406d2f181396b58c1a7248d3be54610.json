{"abstract":"\n \n Existing approaches to multi-game level generation rely upon level structure to emerge organically via level fitness. In this paper, we present a method for generating levels for games in the GVGAI framework using a design pattern-based approach, where design patterns are derived from an analysis of the existing corpus of GVGAI game levels. We created two new generators: one constructive, and one search-based, and compared them to a prior existing search-based generator. Results show that our generator is comparable, even preferred, over the prior generator, especially among players with existing game experience. Our search-based generator also outperforms our constructive generator in terms of player preference.\n \n"}
