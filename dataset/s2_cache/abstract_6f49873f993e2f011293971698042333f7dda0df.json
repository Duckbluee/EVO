{"abstract":"Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimization (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimized using DPO. To further improve training, we introduce a novel multi-round DPO (mrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initializing the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilize the process. To address potential catastrophic forgetting of non-captioning abilities due to mrDPO, we propose rebirth tuning, which finetunes the pre-DPO LLM by using the captions generated by the mrDPO-trained model as supervised labels. Experiments show that mrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing global and local error rates by 40\\% and 20\\%, respectively, while decreasing the repetition rate by 35\\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmark among models of similar size. Upon acceptance, we will release the code, model checkpoints, and training and test data. Demos are available at \\href{https://video-salmonn-2.github.io}{https://video-salmonn-2.github.io}."}
