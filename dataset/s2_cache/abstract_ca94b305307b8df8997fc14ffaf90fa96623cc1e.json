{"abstract":"The task of recommender systems is classically framed as a prediction of users’ preferences and users’ ratings. However, its spirit is to answer a counterfactual question: “What would the rating be if we ‘forced’ the user to watch the movie?” This is a question about an intervention, that is a causal inference question. The key challenge of this causal inference is unobserved confounders, variables that affect both which items the users decide to interact with and how they rate them. To this end, we develop an algorithm that leverages classical recommendation models for causal recommendation. Across simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more robust to unobserved confounders and improves recommendation."}
