{"abstract":"Investing methods and decision-making of the stock market are driven by lots of factors, among all these factors, the significant impact of news should not be overlooked. This article combines machine learning algorithms to analyze sentiment analysis based on daily top 25 news titles and the up and down condition of stock price, using CountVectorizer and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to extract textual feature, then implementing Random Forest (RF) and Logistic Regression (LR) to train, test, and carry out prediction. From the results of the classification report, the performance and efficiency of each combination are analyzed and compared to draw conclusions. The results show that using TF-IDF instead of CountVectorizer can bring higher accuracy in this large and high precision text categorization task. Even if LR can more accurately recall news of stock price declines in binary classification problems, RF has the best performance in the balance of accuracy and classification."}
