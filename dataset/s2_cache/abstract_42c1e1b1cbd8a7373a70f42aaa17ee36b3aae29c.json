{"abstract":"Edge computing (EC) is an emerging paradigm that extends cloud computing by pushing computing resources onto edge servers that are attached to base stations or access points at the edge of the cloud in close proximity with end-users. Due to edge servers’ geographic distribution, the EC paradigm is challenged by many new security threats, including the notorious distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack. In the EC environment, edge servers usually have constrained processing capacities due to their limited sizes. Thus, they are particularly vulnerable to DDoS attacks. DDoS attacks in the EC environment render existing DDoS mitigation approaches obsolete with its new characteristics. In this article, we make the first attempt to tackle the edge DDoS mitigation (EDM) problem. We model it as a constraint optimization problem and prove its <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {NP}$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mi mathvariant=\"script\">NP</mml:mi></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"he-ieq1-3055559.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula>-hardness. To solve this problem, we propose an optimal approach named EDMOpti and a novel game-theoretical approach named EDMGame for mitigating edge DDoS attacks. EDMGame formulates the EDM problem as a potential EDM Game that admits a Nash equilibrium and employs a decentralized algorithm to find the Nash equilibrium as the solution to the EDM problem. Through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that our approaches can solve the EDM problem effectively and efficiently."}
