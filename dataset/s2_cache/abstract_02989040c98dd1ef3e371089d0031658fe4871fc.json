{"abstract":"Existing domain adaptation literature comprises multiple techniques that align the labeled source and unlabeled target domains at different stages, and predict the target labels. In a source-free domain adaptation setting, the source data is not available for alignment. We present a source-free generative paradigm that captures the relations between the source categories and enforces them onto the unlabeled target data, thereby circumventing the need for source data without introducing any new hyper-parameters. The adaptation is performed through the adversarial alignment of the posterior probabilities of the source and target categories. The proposed approach demonstrates competitive performance against other source-free domain adaptation techniques and can also be used for source-present settings."}
