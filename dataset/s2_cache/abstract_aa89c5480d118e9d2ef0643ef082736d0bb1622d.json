{"abstract":"Patent retrieval and analytics have become common tasks in engineering design and innovation. Keyword-based search is the most common method and the core of integrative methods for patent retrieval. Often searchers intuitively choose keywords according to their knowledge on the search interest which may limit the coverage of the retrieval. Although one can identify additional keywords via reading patent texts from prior searches to refine the query terms heuristically, the process is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to human errors. In this paper, we propose a method to automate and augment the heuristic and iterative keyword discovery process. Specifically, we train a semantic engineering knowledge graph on the full patent database using natural language processing and semantic analysis, and use it as the basis to retrieve and rank the keywords contained in the retrieved patents. On this basis, searchers do not need to read patent texts but just select among the recommended keywords to expand their queries. The proposed method improves the completeness of the search keyword set and reduces the human effort for the same task."}
