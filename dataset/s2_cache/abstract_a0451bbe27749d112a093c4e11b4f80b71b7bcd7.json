{"abstract":"In skeleton-based abnormal gait recognition, using original skeleton data decreases the recognition performance because they contain noise and irrelevant information. Instead of feeding original skeletal gait data to a recognition model, features extracted from the skeleton data are normally used. However, existing feature extraction methods might include laborious processes and it is hard for them to minimize the irrelevant information while preserving the important information. To solve this problem, an automatic feature extraction method using a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based Autoencoder (AE) is proposed in this paper. We extracted features from skeletal gait data by using two RNN AEs: a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based AE (LSTM AE) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based AE (GRU AE). The features of the RNN AEs are compared to the original skeleton data and other existing features. We evaluated the features by feeding them to various discriminative models (DMs) and comparing the recognition performances. The features extracted by using the RNN AEs are more easily recognized and robust than the original skeleton data and other existing features. In particular, the LSTM AE shows a better performance than the GRU AE. Compared to single DMs fed with the original skeleton directly, hybrid models where the features of the RNN AEs are fed to DMs show a higher recognition accuracy with fewer training epochs and learning parameters. Therefore, the proposed automatic feature extraction method improves the performance of skeleton-based abnormal gait recognition by reducing laborious processes and increasing the recognition accuracy effectively."}
