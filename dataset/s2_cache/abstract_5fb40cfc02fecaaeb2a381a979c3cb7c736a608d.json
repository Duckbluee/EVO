{"abstract":"Segment Anything Model (SAM) has gained considerable interest in recent times for its remarkable performance and has emerged as a foundational model in computer vision. It has been integrated in diverse downstream tasks, showcasing its strong zero-shot transfer capabilities. Given its impressive performance, there is a strong desire to apply SAM in autonomous driving to improve the performance of vision tasks, particularly in challenging scenarios such as driving under adverse weather conditions. However, its robustness under adverse weather conditions remains uncertain. In this work, we investigate the application of SAM in autonomous driving and specifically explore its robustness under adverse weather conditions. Overall, this work aims to enhance understanding of SAM's robustness in challenging scenarios before integrating it into autonomous driving vision tasks, providing valuable insights for future applications."}
