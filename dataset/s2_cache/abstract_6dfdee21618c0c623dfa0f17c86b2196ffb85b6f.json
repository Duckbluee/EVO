{"abstract":"The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is the key technology of Industry 4.0. The combination of machine learning and IIoT has spawned a thriving smart industry. Machine learning models are trained and predicted based on raw data that contains sensitive information, and data sharing leads to information leakage. Data security and privacy protection in IIoT face serious challenges. Therefore, we propose a federated learning-based privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme (FLPDA) for IIoT. Data aggregation to protect individual user model changes in federated learning against reverse analysis attacks from industry administration centers. Each round of data aggregation uses the PBFT consensus algorithm to select an IIoT device from the aggregation area as the initialization and aggregation node. Paillier cryptosystem and secret sharing are combined to realize data fault tolerance and secure sharing. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that the scheme can effectively protect data privacy and resist various attacks. It has lower communication, computational, and storage overhead than existing schemes."}
