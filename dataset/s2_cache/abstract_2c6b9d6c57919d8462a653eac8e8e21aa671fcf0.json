{"abstract":"Sequential recommendation has become a trending research topic for its capability to capture dynamic user intents based on historical interaction sequence. To train a sequential recommendation model, it is a common practice to optimize the next-item recommendation task with a pairwise ranking loss. In this paper, we revisit this typical training method from the perspective of contrastive learning and find it can be taken as a specialized contrastive learning task conceptually and mathematically, named context-target contrast. Further, to leverage other self-supervised signals in user interaction sequences, we propose another contrastive learning task to encourage sequences after augmentation, as well as sequences with the same target item, to have similar representations, called context-context contrast. A general framework, ContraRec, is designed to unify the two kinds of contrast signals, leading to a holistic joint-learning framework for sequential recommendation with different contrastive learning tasks. Besides, various sequential recommendation methods (e.g., GRU4Rec, Caser, and BERT4Rec) can be easily integrated as the base sequence encoder in our ContraRec framework. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that ContraRec achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods."}
