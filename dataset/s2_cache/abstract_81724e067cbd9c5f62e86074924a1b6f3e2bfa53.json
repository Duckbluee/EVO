{"abstract":"With the ever increasing threat of malware, extensive research effort has been put on applying Deep Learning for malware classification tasks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that process malware as Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) have shown great promise for malware classification. However, these models are viewed as black-boxes, which makes it hard to validate and identify malicious patterns. To that end, we propose CFG-Explainer, a deep learning based model for interpreting GNN-oriented malware classification results. CFGExplainer identifies a subgraph of the malware CFG that contributes most towards classification and provides insight into importance of the nodes (i.e., basic blocks) within it. To the best of our knowledge, CFGExplainer is the first work that explains GNN-based mal-ware classification. We compared CFGExplainer against three explainers, namely GNNExplainer, SubgraphX and PGExplainer, and showed that CFGExplainer is able to identify top equisized subgraphs with higher classification accuracy than the other three models."}
