{"abstract":"The automatic generation of educational questions will play a key role in scaling online education, enabling self-assessment at scale when a global population is manoeuvring their personalised learning journeys. We develop \\textit{EduQG}, a novel educational question generation model built by adapting a large language model. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that \\textit{EduQG} can produce superior educational questions by further pre-training and fine-tuning a pre-trained language model on the scientific text and science question data."}
