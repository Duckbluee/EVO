{"abstract":"In recent years, a number of keyphrase generation (KPG) approaches were proposed consisting of complex model architectures, dedicated training paradigms and decoding strategies. In this work, we opt for simplicity and show how a commonly used seq2seq language model, BART, can be easily adapted to generate keyphrases from the text in a single batch computation using a simple training procedure. Empirical results on five benchmarks show that our approach is as good as the existing state-of-the-art KPG systems, but using a much simpler and easy to deploy framework."}
