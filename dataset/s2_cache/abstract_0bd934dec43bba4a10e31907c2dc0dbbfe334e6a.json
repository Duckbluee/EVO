{"abstract":"Learning fair graph representations for downstream applications is becoming increasingly important, but existing work has mostly focused on improving fairness at the global level by either modify-ing the graph structure or objective function without taking into account the local neighborhood of a node. In this work, we formally introduce the notion of neighborhood fairness and develop a computational framework for learning such locally fair embeddings. We argue that the notion of neighborhood fairness is more appropriate since GNN-based models operate at the local neighborhood level of a node. Our neighborhood fairness framework has two main components that are ﬂexible for learning fair graph representations from arbitrary data: the ﬁrst aims to construct fair neighborhoodsfor any arbitrary node in a graph and the second enables adaptionof these fair neighborhoodsto bettercapture certain application or data-dependent constraints, such as allowing neigh-borhoodstobe more biased towards certain attributesorneighbors in the graph. Furthermore, while link prediction has been exten-sively studied, we are the ﬁrst to investigate the graph representation learning task of fair link classiﬁcation. We demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed neighborhood fairness framework for a variety of graph machine learning tasks including fair link prediction, link classiﬁcation, and learning fair graph embeddings. Notably, our approach achieves not only better fairness but also increases the accuracy in the majority of cases across a wide variety of graphs, problem settings, and metrics."}
