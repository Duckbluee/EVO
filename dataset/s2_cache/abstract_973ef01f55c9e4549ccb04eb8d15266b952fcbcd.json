{"abstract":"A robust and resilient medium access control (MAC) protocol is crucial for numerous machine-type devices to concurrently access the channel in a machine-to-machine (M2M) network. Simplex (reservation- or contention-based) MAC protocols are studied in most literatures which may not be able to provide a scalable solution for M2M networks with large number of heterogeneous devices. In this paper, a scalable hybrid MAC protocol, which consists of a contention period and a transmission period, is designed for heterogeneous M2M networks. In this protocol, different devices with preset priorities (hierarchical contending probabilities) first contend the transmission opportunities following the convention-based p-persistent carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) mechanism. Only the successful devices will be assigned a time slot for transmission following the reservation-based time-division multiple access (TDMA) mechanism. If the devices failed in contention at previous frame, to ensure the fairness among all devices, their contending priorities will be raised by increasing their contending probabilities at the next frame. To balance the tradeoff between the contention and transmission period in each frame, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the channel utility by finding the key design parameters: the contention duration, initial contending probability, and the incremental indicator. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid MAC protocol."}
