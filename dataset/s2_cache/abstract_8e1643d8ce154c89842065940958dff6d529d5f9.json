{"abstract":"The objective of personalization and stylization in text-to-image is to instruct a pre-trained diffusion model to analyze new concepts introduced by users and incorporate them into expected styles. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches have been widely adopted to address this task and have greatly propelled the development of this field. Despite their popularity, existing efficient fine-tuning methods still struggle to achieve effective personalization and stylization in T2I generation. To address this issue, we propose block-wise Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to perform fine-grained fine-tuning for different blocks of SD, which can generate images faithful to input prompts and target identity and also with desired style. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}
