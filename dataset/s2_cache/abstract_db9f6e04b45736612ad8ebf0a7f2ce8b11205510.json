{"abstract":"Effectively detecting anomalous nodes in attributed networks is crucial for the success of many real-world applications such as fraud and intrusion detection. Existing approaches have difficulties with three major issues: sparsity and nonlinearity capturing, residual modeling, and network smoothing. We propose Residual Graph Convolutional Network (ResGCN), an attention-based deep residual modeling approach that can tackle these issues: modeling the attributed networks with GCN allows to capture the sparsity and nonlinearity, utilizing a deep neural network allows direct residual ing from the input, and a residual-based attention mechanism reduces the adverse effect from anomalous nodes and prevents over-smoothing. Extensive experiments on several real-world attributed networks demonstrate the effectiveness of ResGCN in detecting anomalies."}
