{"abstract":"Semantic communications (SemCom) have emerged as a new paradigm for supporting sixth-generation applications with high communication efficiencies. Most existing SemCom techniques utilize deep neural networks (DNNs) to implement analog source-channel mappings, which are incompatible with existing digital communication architectures. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework of digital deep joint source-channel coding ($\\mathrm{D}^{2}$-JSCC) targeting image transmission in SemCom. The framework features digital source and channel codings that are jointly optimized to reduce the end-to-end (E2E) distortion. First, deep source coding with an adaptive density model is designed to efficiently extract and encode semantic features according to their different distributions. Second, channel coding is employed to protect encoded features against channel distortion. To facilitate their joint design, the E2E distortion is characterized as a function of the source and channel rates. Then to minimize the E2E distortion, we propose an efficient two-step algorithm to find the optimal trade-off between the source and channel rates for a given channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Via experiments on simulating the $\\mathbf{D}^{2}$-JSCC with different channel codes and real datasets, the proposed framework is observed to outperform the classic deep JSCC and separation-based approaches."}
