{"abstract":"The time-series GAN and periodic spatial GAN show different yet competitive performance in terms of the evaluation metrics adopted, their deviation from human-designed danmakus, and the diversity of generated danmakus. The preliminary experimental studies presented here showcase that potential of time-series GANs for sequential content generation in games."}
