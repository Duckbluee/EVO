{"abstract":"Human-computer trust has shown to be a critical factor in influencing the complexity and frequency of interaction in technical systems. Particularly incomprehensible situations in human-computer interaction may lead to a reduced users trust in the system and by that influence the style of interaction. Analogous to human-human interaction, explaining these situations can help to remedy negative effects. In this paper we present our approach of augmenting task-oriented dialogs with selected explanation dialogs to foster the humancomputer trust relationship in those kinds of situations. We have conducted a webbased study testing the effects of different goals of explanations on the components of human-computer trust. Subsequently, we show how these results can be used in our probabilistic trust handling architecture to augment pre-defined task-oriented dialogs."}
