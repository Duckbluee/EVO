{"abstract":"The scale of deep learning models has grown tremendously in recent years. State-of-the-art models have reached billions of parameters and terabyte-scale model sizes. Training of these models demands memory bandwidth and capacity that can only be accommodated distributively over hundreds to thousands of GPUs. However, large-scale distributed training suffers from GPU memory inefficiency, such as memory under-utilization and out-of-memory events (OOMs). There is a lack of understanding of actual GPU memory behavior of distributed training on terabyte-size models, which hinders the development of effective solutions to such inefficiency. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of GPU memory behavior of large-scale distributed training jobs in production at Meta. Our analysis is based on offline training jobs of multi-terabyte Deep Learning Recommendation Models from one of Meta's largest production clusters. We measure GPU memory inefficiency; characterize GPU memory utilization, and provide fine-grained GPU memory usage analysis. We further show how to build on the understanding to develop a practical GPU provisioning system in production."}
