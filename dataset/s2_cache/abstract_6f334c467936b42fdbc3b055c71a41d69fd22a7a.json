{"abstract":"In the existing social recommendation algorithms, the performance of the algorithms is bothered by the problem of noise and sparsity in social information. In the past few years, researchers have usually focused on solving noise problem or sparse problem, but ignored a key problem, that is if only solving the noise problem, the sparse problem will become more serious, similarly, if only solving the sparse problem, the noise problem will become more serious. Recently, a few studies attempt to solve both noise and sparse problems, usually using explicit trust features to filter trust information and generate implicit trust friends, but this will depend heavily on the quality of explicit trust features. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an adaptive algorithm based on graph convolution network, The main idea is to learn users’ implicit trust behavior adaptively. Briefly, we use Jaccard similarity coefficient to filter out unnecessary trust information, the reliable trust information will be the users’ trust attributes, then put into the graph convolution network, because of the good feature extraction ability of graph convolution network, we can use adaptive network to learn implicit trust features based on users’ features, the trust features can infer the trust attributes for all users. In order to achieve the best effect of learning, we use iterative repetition of the above process, to mining the implicit influence of user trust behavior, so as to alleviate noise and sparsity problems. Experimental result shows that, on three open datasets: LastFM, Douban and Gowalla, the recommendation performance is improved, which proves the effectiveness of the algorithm."}
