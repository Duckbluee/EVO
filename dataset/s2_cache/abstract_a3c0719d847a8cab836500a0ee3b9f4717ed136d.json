{"abstract":"Natural language processing (NLP) has been studied in computing for decades. Recent technological advancements have led to the development of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT). These models can perform a range of language tasks and generate human-like responses, which offers exciting prospects for academic efficiency. This manuscript aims at (i) exploring the potential benefits and threats of ChatGPT and other NLP technologies in academic writing and research publications; (ii) highlights the ethical considerations involved in using these tools, and (iii) consider the impact they may have on the authenticity and credibility of academic work. This study involved a literature review of relevant scholarly articles published in peer-reviewed journals indexed in Scopus as quartile 1. The search used keywords such as \"ChatGPT,\" \"AI-generated text,\" \"academic writing,\" and \"natural language processing.\" The analysis was carried out using a quasi-qualitative approach, which involved reading and critically evaluating the sources and identifying relevant data to support the research questions. The study found that ChatGPT and other NLP technologies have the potential to enhance academic writing and research efficiency. However, their use also raises concerns about the impact on the authenticity and credibility of academic work. The study highlights the need for comprehensive discussions on the potential use, threats, and limitations of these tools, emphasizing the importance of ethical and academic principles, with human intelligence and critical thinking at the forefront of the research process. This study highlights the need for comprehensive debates and ethical considerations involved in their use. The study also recommends that academics exercise caution when using these tools and ensure transparency in their use, emphasizing the importance of human intelligence and critical thinking in academic work."}
