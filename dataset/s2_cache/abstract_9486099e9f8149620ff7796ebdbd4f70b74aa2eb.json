{"abstract":"This paper explores the effect of traditional TF-IDF and state-of-the-art Large Language models towards anomaly detection in application log files. Four unsupervised learning algorithms are used on three application log files using these models. Results show that each model has advantages and disadvantages depending on the log file used."}
