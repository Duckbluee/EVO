{"abstract":"We consider the problem of determining the energy distribution of quantum states that satisfy exponential decay of correlation and product states, with respect to a quantum local Hamiltonian on a spin lattice. For a quantum state on a D-dimensional lattice that has correlation length σ and has average energy e with respect to a given local Hamiltonian (with n local terms, each of which has norm at most 1), we show that the overlap of this state with eigenspace of energy f is at most exp ( − ( ( e − f ) 2 σ ) 1 D + 1 / n 1 D + 1 D σ ) . This bound holds whenever ∣ e − f ∣ > 2 D n σ . Thus, on a one-dimensional lattice, the tail of the energy distribution decays exponentially with the energy. For product states, we improve above result to obtain a Gaussian decay in energy, even for quantum spin systems without an underlying lattice structure. Given a product state on a collection of spins which has average energy e with respect to a local Hamiltonian (with n local terms and each local term overlapping with at most m other local terms), we show that the overlap of this state with eigenspace of energy f is at most exp ( − ( e − f ) 2 / nm 2 ) . This bound holds whenever ∣ e − f ∣ > m n ."}
