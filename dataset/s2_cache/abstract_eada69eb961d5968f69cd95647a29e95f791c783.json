{"abstract":"Recently, we introduced a new paradigm for alpha mining in the realm of quantitative investment, developing a new interactive alpha mining system framework, Alpha-GPT. This system is centered on iterative Human-AI interaction based on large language models, introducing a Human-in-the-Loop approach to alpha discovery. In this paper, we present the next-generation Alpha-GPT 2.0 \\footnote{Draft. Work in progress}, a quantitative investment framework that further encompasses crucial modeling and analysis phases in quantitative investment. This framework emphasizes the iterative, interactive research between humans and AI, embodying a Human-in-the-Loop strategy throughout the entire quantitative investment pipeline. By assimilating the insights of human researchers into the systematic alpha research process, we effectively leverage the Human-in-the-Loop approach, enhancing the efficiency and precision of quantitative investment research."}
