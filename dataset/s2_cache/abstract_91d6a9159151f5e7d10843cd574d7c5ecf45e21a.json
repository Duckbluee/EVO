{"abstract":"Online insurance is a new type of e-commerce with exponential growth.\nAn effective recommendation model that maximizes the total revenue of insurance products listed in multiple customized sales scenarios is crucial for the success of online insurance business.\nPrior recommendation models are ineffective because they fail to characterize the complex relatedness of insurance products in multiple sales scenarios and maximize the overall conversion rate rather than the total revenue.\nEven worse, it is impractical to collect training data online for total revenue maximization due to the business logic of online insurance.\nWe propose RevMan, a Revenue-aware Multi-task Network for online insurance recommendation.\nRevMan adopts an adaptive attention mechanism to allow effective feature sharing among complex insurance products and sales scenarios.\nIt also designs an efficient offline learning mechanism to learn the rank that maximizes the expected total revenue, by reusing training data and model for conversion rate maximization.\nExtensive offline and online evaluations show that RevMan outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation systems for e-commerce."}
