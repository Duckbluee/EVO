{"abstract":"Measurement(s) knowledge graph • Relation Code • textual entity Technology Type(s) machine learning • computational modeling technique Developing personalized diagnostic strategies and targeted treatments requires a deep understanding of disease biology and the ability to dissect the relationship between molecular and genetic factors and their phenotypic consequences. However, such knowledge is fragmented across publications, non-standardized repositories, and evolving ontologies describing various scales of biological organization between genotypes and clinical phenotypes. Here, we present PrimeKG, a multimodal knowledge graph for precision medicine analyses. PrimeKG integrates 20 high-quality resources to describe 17,080 diseases with 4,050,249 relationships representing ten major biological scales, including disease-associated protein perturbations, biological processes and pathways, anatomical and phenotypic scales, and the entire range of approved drugs with their therapeutic action, considerably expanding previous efforts in disease-rooted knowledge graphs. PrimeKG contains an abundance of ‘indications’, ‘contradictions’, and ‘off-label use’ drug-disease edges that lack in other knowledge graphs and can support AI analyses of how drugs affect disease-associated networks. We supplement PrimeKG’s graph structure with language descriptions of clinical guidelines to enable multimodal analyses and provide instructions for continual updates of PrimeKG as new data become available."}
