{"abstract":"Post COVID-19 and recent advancement in terms of language models, researchers have shown a lot of interest in analyzing social media posts for analyzing mental state of the users. Social media platforms are the epitome of sharing individual thoughts and feelings through textual posts and linguistic cues. Therefore, the textual modality from social media posts can be leveraged for detecting early signs of stress, depression or other mental health conditions, accordingly. Existing methods mainly focus on the feature engineering, shallow learning, and employing of deep learning architectures to improve the mental state recognition performance. Seldom the study uses an established knowledge-base that is available to model mentalization and emotional aspect to improving the depression and stress recognition. In this regard, we propose emotion aware contrastive networks (EAC-net) that leverages the existing knowledge-base and propose some new ones to model the emotional and mentalization aspect in order to improve the recognition of stress and depression state from textual posts. Furthermore, we propose a feature-level fusion and weighting mechanism using gated recurrent units (GRUs) and self-attention layers to weight and select the important features. Last, the EAC-Net uses a supervised contrastive learning strategy to train the network. The proposed method is evaluated on four publicly available datasets. Experimental results reveal that the EAC-Net achieves state-of-the-art results by outperforming baselines and existing methods by atleast 1.86%, 0.72%, 3.43%, and 3.64% on four publicly available datasets using F1-measure as the evaluation metric."}
