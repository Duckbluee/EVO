{"abstract":"In this study, we propose a novel human-like memory architecture designed for enhancing the cognitive abilities of large language model (LLM)-based dialogue agents. Our proposed architecture enables agents to autonomously recall memories necessary for response generation, effectively addressing a limitation in the temporal cognition of LLMs. We adopt the human memory cue recall as a trigger for accurate and efficient memory recall. Moreover, we developed a mathematical model that dynamically quantifies memory consolidation, considering factors such as contextual relevance, elapsed time, and recall frequency. The agent stores memories retrieved from the user’s interaction history in a database that encapsulates each memory’s content and temporal context. Thus, this strategic storage allows agents to recall specific memories and understand their significance to the user in a temporal context, similar to how humans recognize and recall past experiences."}
