{"abstract":"We will elaborate on why it is appropriate to be concerned about structural discrimination induced by future autonomous vehicles—not only in the context of crash-optimization. In order to understand discrimination effects and potential strategies to reduce them, a novel conceptual perspective on how to frame autonomous driving is introduced. According to it, autonomous driving is considered an institutional activity. This perspective enables us to connect to theories about institutional justice—and open new ways to react to discriminatory concerns. To illustrate this direction, we sketch how to apply institutional justice to an autonomous highway driving system."}
