{"abstract":"Detecting polyps through colonoscopy is an important task in medical image segmentation, which provides significant assistance and reference value for clinical surgery. However, accurate segmentation of polyps is a challenging task due to two main reasons. Firstly, polyps exhibit various shapes and colors. Secondly, the boundaries between polyps and their normal surroundings are often unclear. Additionally, significant differences between different datasets lead to limited generalization capabilities of existing methods. To address these issues, we propose a segmentation model based on Prompt-Mamba, which incorporates the latest Vision-Mamba and prompt technologies. Compared to previous models trained on the same dataset, our model not only maintains high segmentation accuracy on the validation part of the same dataset but also demonstrates superior accuracy on unseen datasets, exhibiting excellent generalization capabilities. Notably, we are the first to apply the Vision-Mamba architecture to polyp segmentation and the first to utilize prompt technology in a polyp segmentation model. Our model efficiently accomplishes segmentation tasks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by an average of 5% across six datasets. Furthermore, we have developed multiple versions of our model with scaled parameter counts, achieving better performance than previous models even with fewer parameters. Our code and trained weights will be released soon."}
