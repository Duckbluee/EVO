Proper classification of e-documents, online news, blogs, e-mails and digital libraries need text mining, machine learning and natural language processing tech- niques to get meaningful knowledge. The aim of this paper is to highlight the important techniques and methodologies that are employed in text documents classification, while at the same time making awareness of some of the interesting challenges that remain to be solved, focused mainly on text representation and machine learning techniques. This paper provides a review of the theory and methods of document classification and text mining, focusing on the existing litera- ture."}
