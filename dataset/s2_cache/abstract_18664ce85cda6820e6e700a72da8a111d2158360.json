{"abstract":"The study of electromagnetic detection satellite scheduling problem (EDSSP) has attracted attention due to the detection requirements for a large number of targets. This paper proposes a mixed-integer programming model for the EDSSP problem and a genetic algorithm based on reinforcement learning (RL-GA). Numerous factors that affect electromagnetic detection are considered in the model, such as detection mode, bandwidth, and other factors. The RL-GA embeds a Q-learning method into an improved genetic algorithm, and the evolution of each individual depends on the decision of the agent. Q-learning is used to guide the population search process by choosing evolution operators. In this way, the search information can be effectively used by the reinforcement learning method. In the algorithm, we design a reward function to update the Q value. According to the problem characteristics, a new combination ofis proposed. The RL-GA also uses an elite individual retention strategy to improve search performance. After that, a task time window selection algorithm (TTWSA) is proposed to evaluate the performance of population evolution. Several experiments are used to examine the scheduling effect of the proposed algorithm. Through the experimental verification of multiple instances, it can be seen that the RL-GA can solve the EDSSP problem effectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, the RL-GA performs better in several aspects."}
