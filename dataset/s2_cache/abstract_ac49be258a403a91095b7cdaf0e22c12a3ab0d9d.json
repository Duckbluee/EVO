{"abstract":"Malicious applications of deep face swapping technology pose security threats such as misinformation dissemination and identity fraud. Some research propose the utilization of robust watermarking methods to track the copyright of facial images, facilitating post-forgery identity attribution. However, these methods cannot fundamentally prevent or eliminate the adverse impacts of face swapping. To address this issue, we present Dual Defense, an innovative framework based on robust adversarial watermarking. It simultaneously tracks image copyrights and disrupts the face swapping model by one-time embedding the robust adversarial watermark. Specifically, we propose an Original-domain Feature Emulation Attack (OFEA) method, which makes the traceable watermark adversarial through specially designed original domain adversarial loss. Additionally, we conduct a wavelet domain image structural information compensation loss, combined with a channel attention mechanism, to jointly balance watermark invisibility, adversariality, and traceability. Furthermore, we design a more comprehensive and rational evaluation method to thoroughly assess the effectiveness of adversarial attacks against face swapping models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dual Defense exhibits exceptional cross-task generality and dataset generalization. It maintains impressive adversariality and traceability in both original and robust settings, surpassing current forgery defense methods that possess only one of these capabilities."}
