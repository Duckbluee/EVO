{"abstract":"Photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) accurately estimates geometry from video. However, current PBA systems have a temporary map that cannot manage scene reobservations. We present, direct sparse mapping, a full monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) based on PBA. Its persistent map handles reobservations, yielding the most accurate results up to date on EuRoC for a direct method."}
