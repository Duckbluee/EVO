{"abstract":"One of the most significant map services in navigation applications is route recommendation. However, most route recommendation systems only recommend trips based on time and distance, impacting quality-of-experience and route selection. This paper introduces a novel framework, namely MARRS, a multi-objective route recommendation system based on heterogeneous urban sensing open data (i.e., crime, accident, traffic flow, road network, meteorological, calendar event, and point of interest distributions). We introduce a wide, deep, and multitask-learning (WD-MTL) framework that uses a transformer to extract spatial, temporal, and semantic correlation for predicting crime, accident, and traffic flow of particular road segment. Later, for a particular source and destination, the adaptive epsilon constraint technique is used to optimize route satisfying multiple objective functions. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of figuring out the safest and efficient route selection."}
