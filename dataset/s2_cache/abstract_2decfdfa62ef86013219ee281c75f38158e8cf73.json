{"abstract":"Deep learning models on graphs have achieved remarkable performance in various graph analysis tasks, e.g., node classification, link prediction and graph clustering. However, they expose uncertainty and unreliability against the well-designed inputs, i.e., adversarial examples. Accordingly, a line of studies have emerged for both attack and defense addressed in different graph analysis tasks, leading to the arms race in graph adversarial learning. \nDespite the booming works, there still lacks a unified problem definition and a comprehensive review. To bridge this gap, we investigate and summarize the existing works on graph adversarial learning tasks systemically. Specifically, we survey and unify the existing works w.r.t. attack and defense in graph analysis tasks, and give appropriate definitions and taxonomies at the same time. Besides, we emphasize the importance of related evaluation metrics, investigate and summarize them comprehensively. Hopefully, our works can provide a comprehensive overview and offer insights for the relevant researchers. More details of our works are available at this https URL."}
