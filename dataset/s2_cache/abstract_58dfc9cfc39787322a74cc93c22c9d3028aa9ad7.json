{"abstract":"Video editing is a challenging task that requires manipulating videos on both the spatial and temporal dimensions. Existing methods for video editing mainly focus on changing the appearance or style of the objects in the video, while keeping their structures unchanged. However, there is no existing method that allows users to interactively ``drag'' any points of instances on the first frame to precisely reach the target points with other frames consistently deformed. In this paper, we propose a new diffusion-based method for interactive point-based video manipulation, called Drag-A-Video. Our method allows users to click pairs of handle points and target points as well as masks on the first frame of an input video. Then, our method transforms the inputs into point sets and propagates these sets across frames. To precisely modify the contents of the video, we employ a new video-level motion supervision to update the features of the video and introduce the latent offsets to achieve this update at multiple denoising timesteps. We propose a temporal-consistent point tracking module to coordinate the movement of the points in the handle point sets. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our method on various videos. The website of our work is available here: https://drag-a-video.github.io/."}
