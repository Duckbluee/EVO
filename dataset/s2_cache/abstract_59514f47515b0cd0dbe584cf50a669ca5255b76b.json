{"abstract":"Current blockchains are restricted by the low throughput. Aimed at this problem, we propose Txilm, a protocol that compresses the size of transaction presentation in each block to save the bandwidth of the network. In this protocol, a block carries short hashes of TXIDs instead of complete transactions. Combined with the sorted transactions based on TXIDs, Txilm realizes 80 times of data size reduction compared with the original blockchains. We also evaluate the probability of hash collisions, and provide methods of resolving such collisions. Finally, we design strategies to protect against potential attacks on Txilm."}
