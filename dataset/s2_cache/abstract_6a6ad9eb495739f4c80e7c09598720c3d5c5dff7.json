{"abstract":"Federated learning (also known as collaborative learning) is a machine learning technique that trains\nan algorithm without transferring data samples across numerous decentralized edge devices or\nservers. This strategy differs from standard centralized machine learning techniques in which all local\ndatasets are uploaded to a single server, as well as more traditional decentralized alternatives, which\nfrequently presume that local data samples are uniformly distributed.\nFederated learning allows several actors to collaborate on the development of a single, robust\nmachine learning model without sharing data, allowing crucial issues such as data privacy, data\nsecurity, data access rights, and access to heterogeneous data to be addressed. Defence,\ntelecommunications, internet of things, and pharmaceutical industries are just a few of the sectors\nwhere it has applications."}
