{"abstract":"We consider the existence in arbitrary finite dimensions d of a positive operator valued measure (POVM) comprised of d2 rank-one operators all of whose operator inner products are equal. Such a set is called a “symmetric, informationally complete” POVM (SIC–POVM) and is equivalent to a set of d2 equiangular lines in Cd. SIC–POVMs are relevant for quantum state tomography, quantum cryptography, and foundational issues in quantum mechanics. We construct SIC–POVMs in dimensions two, three, and four. We further conjecture that a particular kind of group-covariant SIC–POVM exists in arbitrary dimensions, providing numerical results up to dimension 45 to bolster this claim."}
