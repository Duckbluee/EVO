{"abstract":"For material modeling and discovery, synthetic microstructures play a critical role as digital twins. They provide stochastic samples upon which direct numerical simulations can be conducted to populate material databases. A large ensemble of simulation data on synthetic microstructures may provide supplemental data to inform and refine macroscopic material models, which might not be feasible from physical experiments alone. However, synthesizing realistic microstructures with realistic microstructural attributes is highly challenging. Thus, it is often oversimplified via rough approximations that may yield an inaccurate representation of the physical world. Here, we propose a novel deep learning method that can synthesize realistic three-dimensional microstructures with controlled structural properties using the combination of generative adversarial networks (GAN) and actor-critic (AC) reinforcement learning. The GAN-AC combination enables the generation of microstructures that not only resemble the appearances of real specimens but also yield user-defined physical quantities of interest (QoI). Our validation experiments confirm that the properties of synthetic microstructures generated by the GAN-AC framework are within a 5% error margin with respect to the target values. The scientific contribution of this paper resides in the novel design of the GAN-AC microstructure generator and the mathematical and algorithmic foundations therein. The proposed method will have a broad and substantive impact on the materials community by providing lenses for analyzing structure-property-performance linkages and for implementing the notion of ‘materials-by-design’."}
