{"abstract":"This paper describes our submission to ICASSP 2023 MUG Challenge Track 4, Keyphrase Extraction, which aims to extract keyphrases most relevant to the conference theme from conference materials. We model the challenge as a single-class Named Entity Recognition task and developed techniques for better performance on the challenge: For the data preprocessing, we encode the split keyphrases after word segmentation. In addition, we increase the amount of input information that the model can accept at one time by fusing multiple preprocessed sentences into one segment. We replace the loss function with the multi-class focal loss to address the sparseness of keyphrases. Besides, we score each appearance of keyphrases and add an extra output layer to fit the score to rank keyphrases. Exhaustive evaluations are performed to find the best combination of the word segmentation tool, the pre-trained embedding model, and the corresponding hyperparameters. With these proposals, we scored 45.04 on the final test set."}
