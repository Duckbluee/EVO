{"abstract":"Graphs can facilitate modeling various complex systems such as gene networks and power grids as well as analyzing the underlying relations within them. Learning over graphs has recently attracted increasing attention, particularly graph neural network (GNN)–based solutions, among which graph attention networks (GATs) have become one of the most widely utilized neural network structures for graph-based tasks. Although it is shown that the use of graph structures in learning results in the amplification of algorithmic bias, the influence of the attention design in GATs on algorithmic bias has not been investigated. Motivated by this, the present study first carries out a theoretical analysis in order to demonstrate the sources of algorithmic bias in GAT-based learning for node classification. Then, a novel algorithm, FairGAT, which leverages a fairness-aware attention design, is developed based on the theoretical findings. Experimental results on real-world networks demonstrate that FairGAT improves group fairness measures while also providing comparable utility to the fairness-aware baselines for node classification and link prediction."}
