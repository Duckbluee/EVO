{"abstract":"Keyphrase extraction is the task of finding several interesting phrases in a text document, which provide a list of the main topics within the document. Most existing graph-based models use co-occurrence links as cohesion indicators to model the relationship of syntactic elements. However, a word may have different forms of expression within the document, and may have several synonyms as well. Simply using co-occurrence information cannot capture this information. In this paper, we enhance the graph-based ranking model by leveraging word embeddings as background knowledge to add semantic information to the inter-word graph. Our approach is evaluated on established benchmark datasets and empirical results show that the word embedding neighborhood information improves the model performance."}
