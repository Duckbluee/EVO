{"abstract":"Traffic flow forecasting is challenging due to the intricate spatio-temporal correlations in traffic flow data. Existing Transformer-based methods usually treat traffic flow forecasting as multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. However, too many sensors can cause a vector with a dimension greater than 800, which is difficult to process without information loss. In addition, these methods design complex mechanisms to capture spatial dependencies in MTS, resulting in slow forecasting speed. To solve the abovementioned problems, we propose a Fast Pure Transformer Network (FPTN) in this paper. First, the traffic flow data are divided into sequences along the sensor dimension instead of the time dimension. Then, to adequately represent complex spatio-temporal correlations, Three types of embeddings are proposed for projecting these vectors into a suitable vector space. After that, to capture the complex spatio-temporal correlations simultaneously in these vectors, we utilize Transformer encoder and stack it with several layers. Extensive experiments are conducted with 4 real-world datasets and 13 baselines, which demonstrate that FPTN outperforms the state-of-the-art on two metrics. Meanwhile, the computational time of FPTN spent is less than a quarter of other state-of-the-art Transformer-based models spent, and the requirements for computing resources are significantly reduced."}
