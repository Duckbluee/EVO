{"abstract":"Current state-of-the-art point cloud-based perception methods usually rely on large-scale labeled data, which requires expensive manual annotations. A natural option is to explore the unsupervised methodology for 3D perception tasks. However, such methods often face substantial performance-drop difficulties. Fortunately, we found that there exist amounts of image-based datasets and an alternative can be proposed, i.e., transferring the knowledge in the 2D images to 3D point clouds. Specifically, we propose a novel approach for the challenging cross-modal and cross-domain adaptation task by fully exploring the relationship between images and point clouds and designing effective feature alignment strategies. Without any 3D labels, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation on SemanticKITTI by using the knowledge of KITTI360 and GTA5, compared to existing unsupervised and weakly-supervised baselines."}
