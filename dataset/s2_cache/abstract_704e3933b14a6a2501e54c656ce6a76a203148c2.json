{"abstract":"Point clouds acquired with LiDAR are widely adopted in various fields, such as three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction, autonomous driving, and robotics. However, the high-density point cloud of large scenes captured with Lidar usually contains a large number of virtual points generated by the specular reflections of reflective materials, such as glass. When applying such large-scale high-density point clouds, reflection noise may have a significant impact on 3D reconstruction and other related techniques. In this study, we propose a method that uses deep learning and multi-position sensor comparison method to remove noise due to reflections from high-density point clouds in large scenes. The proposed method converts large-scale high-density point clouds into a range image and subsequently uses a deep learning method and multi-position sensor comparison method for noise detection. This alleviates the limitation of the deep learning networks, specifically their inability to handle large-scale high-density point clouds. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect and remove noise due to reflection."}
