{"abstract":"Despite increased cloud service providers following advanced cloud infrastructure management, substantial execution time is lost due to minimal server usage. Given the importance of reducing total execution time (makespan) for cloud service providers (as a vital metric) during sustaining Quality-of-Service (QoS), this study established an enhanced scheduling algorithm for minimal cloudlet scheduling (CS) makespan with the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm under MCS-DQN. A novel reward function was recommended to enhance the DQN model convergence. Additionally, an open-source simulator (CloudSim) was employed to assess the suggested work performance. Resultantly, the recommended MCS-DQN scheduler revealed optimal outcomes to minimise the makespan metric and other counterparts (task waiting period, resource usage of virtual machines, and the extent of incongruence against the algorithms)."}
