{"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a vocoder based on a pair of forward and reverse-time linear stochastic differential equations (SDE). The solutions of this SDE pair are two stochastic processes, one of which turns the distribution of wave, that we want to generate, into a simple and tractable distribution. The other is the generation procedure that turns this tractable simple signal into the target wave. The model is called ItôWave. It uses the Wiener process as a driver to gradually subtract the excess signal from the noise signal to generate realistic corresponding meaningful audio respectively, under the conditional inputs of original mel spectrogram. The results of the experiment show that the mean opinion scores (MOS) of ItôWave can exceed the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, and reached 4.35±0.115. The generated audio samples are available online1."}
