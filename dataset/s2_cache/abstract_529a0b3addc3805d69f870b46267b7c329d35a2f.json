{"abstract":"Abstract This article focuses on the development of a custom chatbot for Zayed University Library (United Arab Emirates) using Python and the ChatGPT API. The chatbot, named Aisha, was designed to provide quick and efficient reference and support services to students and faculty outside the library’s regular operating hours. The article also discusses the benefits of chatbots in academic libraries, and reviews the early literature on ChatGPT's applicability in this field. The article describes the development process, perceived capabilities and limitations of the bot, and plans for further development. This project represents the first fully reported attempt to explore the potential of a ChatGPT-based bot in academic libraries, and provides insights into the future of AI-based chatbot technology in this context."}
