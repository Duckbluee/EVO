These models are emerging as an effort toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by both exploring an alternative to just increasing datasets' and models' sizes and combining Learning over the data distribution, Reasoning on prior and learned knowledge, and by symbiotically using them. This survey investigates research papers in this area during recent years and brings classification and comparison between the presented models as well as applications."}
