{"abstract":"Using synthesized images to boost the performance of perception models is a long-standing research challenge in computer vision. It becomes more eminent in visual-centric autonomous driving systems with multi-view cameras as some long-tail scenarios can never be collected. Guided by the BEV segmentation layouts, the existing generative networks seem to synthesize photo-realistic street-view images when evaluated solely on scene-level metrics. However, once zoom-in, they usually fail to produce accurate foreground and background details such as heading. To this end, we propose a two-stage generative method, dubbed BEVControl, that can generate accurate foreground and background contents. In contrast to segmentation-like input, it also supports sketch style input, which is more flexible for humans to edit. In addition, we propose a comprehensive multi-level evaluation protocol to fairly compare the quality of the generated scene, foreground object, and background geometry. Our extensive experiments show that our BEVControl surpasses the state-of-the-art method, BEVGen, by a significant margin, from 5.89 to 26.80 on foreground segmentation mIoU. In addition, we show that using images generated by BEVControl to train the downstream perception model, it achieves on average 1.29 improvement in NDS score."}
