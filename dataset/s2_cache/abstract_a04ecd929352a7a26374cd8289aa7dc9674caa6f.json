{"abstract":"Violence detection is an essential and challenging problem in the computer vision community. Most existing works focus on single modal data analysis, which is not effective when multi-modality is available. Therefore, we propose a two-stage multi-modal information fusion method for violence detection: 1) the first stage adopts multiple instance learning strategies to refine video-level hard labels into clip-level soft labels, and 2) the next stage uses multi-modal information fused attention module to achieve fusion, and supervised learning is carried out using the soft labels generated at the first stage. Extensive empirical evidence on the XD-Violence dataset shows that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."}
