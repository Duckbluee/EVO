{"abstract":"To help related operators to allocate and dispatch the number of bike-sharing and provide good guidance for setting up electronic fences, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal graph convolution network prediction model (SGCNPM) with multiple factors to enhance the accuracy of predicting the demand for bike-sharing. First, we consider time, built environment, and weather. We use a multigraph convolution network (GCN) to model the built environment, utilize a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract temporal features, and utilize a fully connected network (FCN) to model weather influence. We construct SGCNPM which can effectively fuse GCN, LSTM, and FCN, thus creating a prediction method considering the influence of multiple factors. The results of the real case in Tianjin, China, show that the proposed model can perform well in improving prediction accuracy. Also, we analyze the influence of factors on model prediction results in different periods."}
