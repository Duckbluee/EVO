{"abstract":"Blockchain technology and Internet of Things technology are two new technologies formed in the current transmission of information technology. In the implementation of its technical control, it can scientifically control the information sharing work and realize the artificial adjustment of the transmission control of the Internet of Things technology. In this paper, research on the Internet of Things data sharing model based on block chain with a view to provide guidance to the security of Things data sharing technology under the block chain. In this paper, Hyperledger Fabric block chain platform-based platform, proposed a block-based chain of IOT data sharing model, security and data privacy is an enhancement, obtained by the performance of the test model. Throughput is maximized when the write transaction sending frequency is 100 TPS and the query transaction sending frequency is 250 TPS. The maximum write throughput is 60 TPS, which is better than Bitcoin and Ethereum on the public chain, which proves the feasibility of the model implementation. This model can achieve storage and sharing without the help of a third-party centralized organization, and directly establish trust between participants, which can ensure the safe sharing of data."}
