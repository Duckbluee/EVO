{"abstract":"Recently, inversion methods have been exploring the incorporation of additional high-rate information from pretrained generators (such as weights or intermediate features) to improve the refinement of inversion and editing results from embedded latent codes. While such techniques have shown reasonable improvements in reconstruction, they often lead to a decrease in editing capability, especially when dealing with complex images that contain occlusions, detailed backgrounds, and artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a novel refinement mechanism called Domain-Specific Hybrid Refinement (DHR), which draws on the advantages and disadvantages of two mainstream refinement techniques. We find that the weight modulation can gain favorable editing results but is vulnerable to these complex image areas and feature modulation is efficient at reconstructing. Hence, we divide the image into two domains and process them with these two methods separately. We first propose a Domain-Specific Segmentation module to automatically segment images into in-domain and out-of-domain parts according to their invertibility and editability without additional data annotation, where our hybrid refinement process aims to maintain the editing capability for in-domain areas and improve fidelity for both of them. We achieve this through Hybrid Modulation Refinement, which respectively refines these two domains by weight modulation and feature modulation. Our proposed method is compatible with all latent code embedding methods. Extension experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art in real image inversion and editing.
