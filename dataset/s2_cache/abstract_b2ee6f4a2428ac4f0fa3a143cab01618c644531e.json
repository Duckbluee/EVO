{"abstract":"We introduce FIDAVL: Fake Image Detection and Attribution using a Vision-Language Model. FIDAVL is a novel and efficient mul-titask approach inspired by the synergies between vision and language processing. Leveraging the benefits of zero-shot learning, FIDAVL exploits the complementarity between vision and language along with soft prompt-tuning strategy to detect fake images and accurately attribute them to their originating source models. We conducted extensive experiments on a comprehensive dataset comprising synthetic images generated by various state-of-the-art models. Our results demonstrate that FIDAVL achieves an encouraging average detection accuracy of 95.42% and F1-score of 95.47% while also obtaining noteworthy performance metrics, with an average F1-score of 92.64% and ROUGE-L score of 96.50% for attributing synthetic images to their respective source generation models.
