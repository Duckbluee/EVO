{"abstract":"The increasing attraction of high-risk investments for retail investors has fuelled speculation across social media platforms on stocks with a perceived likelihood for disproportionate returns. This paper investigates the capacity of one such forum’s (Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets) speculation and the prevailing literature on how value should be maximally extracted from a community’s insights. With comparative research focused on aggregating the sentiment of a community – we took an individualized approach – and sought to understand the role of forum member posts in stock price predictions. Utilizing a sentiment sliding window and trust filter enabled a 40% reduction in errors compared to not applying these techniques with the financial and Reddit data."}
