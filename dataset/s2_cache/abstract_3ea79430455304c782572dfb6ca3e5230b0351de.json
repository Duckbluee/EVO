{"abstract":"The recently proposed Vision transformers (ViTs) have shown\nvery impressive empirical performance in various computer vision tasks,\nand they are viewed as an important type of foundation model. However, ViTs are typically constructed with large-scale sizes, which then\nseverely hinder their potential deployment in many practical resources constrained applications. \nTo mitigate this challenging problem, structured pruning is a promising solution to compress model size and enable\npractical efficiency. However, unlike its current popularity for CNNs and\nRNNs, structured pruning for ViT models is little explored.\nIn this paper, we propose GOHSP, a unified framework of Graph and\nOptimization-based Structured Pruning for ViT models. We first develop\na graph-based ranking for measuring the importance of attention heads,\nand the extracted importance information is further integrated to an\noptimization-based procedure to impose the heterogeneous structured\nsparsity patterns on the ViT models. Experimental results show that\nour proposed GOHSP demonstrates excellent compression performance.\nOn CIFAR-10 dataset, our approach can bring 40% parameters reduction\nwith no accuracy loss for ViT-Small model. On ImageNet dataset, with\n30% and 35% sparsity ratio for DeiT-Tiny and DeiT-Small models, our\napproach achieves 1.65% and 0.76% accuracy increase over the existing\nstructured pruning methods, respectively."}
