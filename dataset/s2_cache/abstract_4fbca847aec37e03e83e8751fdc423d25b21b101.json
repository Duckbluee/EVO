{"abstract":"Networked systems emerge and subsequently evolve. Although several models describe the process of network evolution, researchers know far less about the initial process of network emergence. Here, we report temporal survey results of a real-world social network starting from its point of inception. We find that individuals’ ties undergo an initial cycle of rapid expansion and contraction. This process helps to explain the eventual interactions and working structure in the network (in this case, scientific collaboration). We propose a stylized concept and model of “churn” to describe the process of network emergence and stabilization. Our empirical and simulation results suggest that these network emergence dynamics may be instrumental for explaining network details, as well as behavioral outcomes at later time periods."}
