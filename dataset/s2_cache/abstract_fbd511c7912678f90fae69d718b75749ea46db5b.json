{"abstract":"Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is considered as one of the most promising revolutionary technologies to prompt smart manufacturing and increase productivity. With manufacturing being more complicated and sophisticated, an entire manufacturing process usually involves several different administrative IoT domains (e.g., factories). Devices from different domains collaborate on the same task, which raises great security and privacy concerns about device-to-device communications. Existing authentication approaches may result in heavy key management overhead or rely on a trusted third party. Thus, security and privacy issues during communication remain unsolved but imperative. In this paper, we present an efficient blockchain-assisted secure device authentication mechanism $\\textsf{BASA}$ for cross-domain IIoT. Specifically, consortium blockchain is introduced to construct trust among different domains. Identity-based signature (IBS) is exploited during the authentication process. To preserve the privacy of devices, we design an identity management mechanism, which can realize that devices being authenticated remain anonymous. Besides, session keys between two parties are negotiated, which can secure the subsequent communications. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed mechanism."}
