{"abstract":"We introduce multinode quantum trajectory simulations with qsim, an open source high performance simulator of quantum circuits. qsim can be used as a backend of Cirq, a Python software library for writing quantum circuits. We present a novel delayed inner product algorithm for quantum trajectories which can result in an order of magnitude speedup for low noise simulation. We also provide tools to use this framework in Google Cloud Platform, with high performance virtual machines in a single mode or multinode setting. Multinode configurations are well suited to simulate noisy quantum circuits with quantum trajectories. Finally, we introduce an approximate noise model for Google's experimental quantum computing platform and compare the results of noisy simulations with experiments for several quantum algorithms on Google's Quantum Computing Service."}
