{"abstract":"In Semantic Textual Similarity, systems rate the degree of semantic equivalence between two text snippets. This year, the participants were challenged with new data sets for English, as well as the introduction of Spanish, as a new language in which to assess semantic similarity. For the English subtask, we exposed the systems to a diversity of testing scenarios, by preparing additional OntoNotesWordNet sense mappings and news headlines, as well as introducing new genres, including image descriptions, DEFT discussion forums, DEFT newswire, and tweet-newswire headline mappings. For Spanish, since, to our knowledge, this is the first time that official evaluations are conducted, we used well-formed text, by featuring sentences extracted from encyclopedic content and newswire. The annotations for both tasks leveraged crowdsourcing. The Spanish subtask engaged 9 teams participating with 22 system runs, and the English subtask attracted 15 teams with 38 system runs."}
