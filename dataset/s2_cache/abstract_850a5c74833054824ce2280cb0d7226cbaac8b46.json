{"abstract":"Recently, Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has gained significant attention from society, especially with the rise of Generative AI (GAI) techniques such as ChatGPT, GPT-4 [165], DALL-E-3 [184], and Sora [137]. AIGC involves using AI models to create digital content, such as images, music, and natural language, with the goal of making the content creation process more efficient and accessible. Large-scale models have become increasingly important in AIGC as they provide better intent extraction and generation results. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the history of generative models and recent advances in AIGC, focusing on both unimodal and multimodal interaction. From the perspective of unimodality, we introduce the generation tasks and relative models of text and image. From the perspective of multimodality, we introduce the cross-application between the modalities mentioned above. Finally, the survey discusses the existing open problems and future challenges in AIGC. Overall, this survey serves as a valuable resource for individuals interested in understanding the background and secrets behind the impressive performance of AIGC techniques."}
