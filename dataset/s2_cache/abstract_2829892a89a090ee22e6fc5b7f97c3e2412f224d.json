{"abstract":"Text Summarization is the process of extracting essential parts from a source text. The generated summary will aid in decreasing the time and effort necessary to read the complete text. We will look into the use case of text summarization of meeting transcripts in this paper. We look at how to find words and phrases that effectively reflect or contribute to the semantic essence of decisions made in multi-party human-to-human talks. Before evaluating alternative ways for getting information from these interactions, we will first provide a quick overview of our approach to modelling decision debates in meetings. We consider the difficulty of compressing a series of related sentences into a single short sentence, often known as multi-sentence compression. We will also consider the necessity to recognise and distinguish between decisions and conversation, as well as argument mining."}
