{"abstract":"The paper considers the problem of multi-agent consensus in the presence of adversarial agents which may try to prevent and introduce undesired influence on the coordination among the regular agents. To our setting, we extend the so- called mean subsequence reduced algorithms with the aim to reduce the amount of communication via two measures: The agents exchange information in the form of ternary data at each transmission and moreover keep the frequency of data exchange low by employing self- and event-triggered communication. We will observe that in hostile environments with adversaries, the self-triggered approach can bring certain advantages over the event-triggered counterpart."}
