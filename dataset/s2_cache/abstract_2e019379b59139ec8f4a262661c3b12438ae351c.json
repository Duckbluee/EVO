{"abstract":"A feature-based log parsing method is presented for extracting log events from unstructured free-text logs. It is a data-driven log analytic solution with no training data needed and suitable for various types of log parsing tasks. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve higher accuracy and lower time complexity in large-scale log data than existing log parsing methods."}
