{"abstract":"Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy by keeping data local. Traditional FL approaches rely on a centralized, star-shaped topology, where a central server aggregates model updates from clients. However, this architecture introduces several limitations, including a single point of failure, limited personalization, and poor robustness to distribution shifts or vulnerability to malfunctioning clients. Moreover, update selection in centralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be unreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and offer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework. It leverages the flexibility of the P2P topology to enable each client to identify and aggregate a personalized set of trustworthy and beneficial updates.This framework is the Local Inference Guided Aggregation for Heterogeneous Training Environments to Yield Enhancement Through Agreement and Regularization (LIGHTYEAR). Central to our method is an agreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the semantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to the clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored subset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that further stabilizes the training. Our empirical evaluation across five datasets shows that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both, centralized baselines and existing P2P methods in terms of client-level performance, particularly under adversarial and heterogeneous conditions."}
