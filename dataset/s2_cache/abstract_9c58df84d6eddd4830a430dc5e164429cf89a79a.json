{"abstract":"Automated audio captioning (AAC) has developed rapidly in recent years, involving acoustic signal processing and natural language processing to generate human-readable sentences for audio clips. The current models are generally based on the neural encoder-decoder architecture, and their decoder mainly uses acoustic information that is extracted from the CNN-based encoder. However, they have ignored semantic information that could help the AAC model to generate meaningful descriptions. This paper proposes a novel approach for automated audio captioning based on incorporating semantic and acoustic information. Specifically, our audio captioning model consists of two sub-modules. (1) The pre-trained keyword encoder utilizes pre-trained ResNet38 to initialize its parameters, and then it is trained by extracted keywords as labels. (2) The multi-modal attention decoder adopts an LSTM-based decoder that contains semantic and acoustic attention modules. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Clotho dataset. Our code can be found at https://github.com/WangHelin1997/DCASE2021_Task6_PKU"}
