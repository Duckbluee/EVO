{"abstract":"In recent years, there have been significant advancements in 3D reconstruction and dense RGB-D SLAM systems. One notable development is the application of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in these systems, which utilizes implicit neural representation to encode 3D scenes. However, the depth images obtained from consumer-grade RGB-D sensors are often sparse and noisy, which poses significant challenges for 3D reconstruction and affects the accuracy of the representation of the scene geometry. Furthermore, existing methods select random pixels for camera tracking, leading to inaccurate localization in real-world indoor environments. To this end, we present NeSLAM, an advanced framework that achieves accurate and dense depth estimation, robust camera tracking, and realistic synthesis of novel views. First, a depth completion and denoising network is designed to provide dense geometry prior and guide the neural implicit representation optimization. Second, we propose a NeRF-based self-supervised feature tracking algorithm for robust real-time tracking. Experiments on various indoor datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the system in reconstruction, tracking quality, and novel view synthesis. Note to Practitioners—Traditional SLAM methods usually use the sparse point cloud to represent the scene, resulting in poor scene representation capability. Our method proposes a neural implicit representation method with depth completion and denoising network and feature tracking method, achieves accurate scene reconstruction and accurate pose estimation in various indoor scenes. The depth completion and denoising network provide accurate depth information associated with depth uncertainty, which is used to improve the geometry consistency. The NeRF-based self-supervised feature tracking method improve the accuracy and robustness for camera tracking. The experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of this method in different scenes."}
