{"abstract":"Several RGB-D datasets have been publicized over the past few years for facilitating research in computer vision and robotics. However, the lack of comprehensive and fine-grained annotation in these RGB-D datasets has posed challenges to their widespread usage. In this paper, we introduce SceneNN, an RGB-D scene dataset consisting of 100 scenes. All scenes are reconstructed into triangle meshes and have per-vertex and per-pixel annotation. We further enriched the dataset with fine-grained information such as axis-aligned bounding boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and object poses. We used the dataset as a benchmark to evaluate the state-of-the-art methods on relevant research problems such as intrinsic decomposition and shape completion. Our dataset and annotation tools are available at http://www.scenenn.net."}
