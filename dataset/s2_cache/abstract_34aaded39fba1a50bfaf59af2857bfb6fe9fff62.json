{"abstract":"Abstract Industry 4.0 and its main enabling information and communication technologies are completely changing both services and production worlds. This is especially true for the health domain, where the Internet of Things, Cloud and Fog Computing, and Big Data technologies are revolutionizing eHealth and its whole ecosystem, moving it towards Healthcare 4.0. By selectively analyzing the literature, we systematically survey how the adoption of the above-mentioned Industry 4.0 technologies (and their integration) applied to the health domain is changing the way to provide traditional services and products. In this paper, we provide (i) a description of the main technologies and paradigms in relation to Healthcare 4.0 and discuss (ii) their main application scenarios; we then provide an analysis of (iii) carried benefits and (iv) novel cross-disciplinary challenges; finally, we extract (v) the lessons learned."}
