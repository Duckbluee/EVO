{"abstract":"Developing a 2D horror game and evaluating the reliability of the player experience are two things that are interrelated and equally important. Developers must ensure that the game can provide a satisfying and reliable gaming experience for its players. This study aims to evaluate the reliability of the player's experience in the game entitled Alas Tilas, East Java. This study used User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) in Indonesian as survey approach method which was given to 30 teenager respondents who at least played horror games once. UEQ may provide feedback to developers on the Attractiveness, Clarity, Efficiency, Accuracy, Stimulation, and Novelty aspects of the game. From the results of the UEQ, a reliability test will be carried out using the Cronbach Alpha Technique. The results of the descriptive analysis show that these variables are Attractiveness (mean, 0.933), Clarity (mean, 1.808), Efficiency (mean, 1.508), Accuracy (mean, 0.217), Stimulation (mean, 0.667) and Novelty (mean, 0.242). Attractiveness, Clarity and Efficiency averaged positive results. While the average aspects of accuracy, stimulation and novelty of the game get neutral results. The results of the reliability test conducted on UEQ data obtained a Cronbach alpha value > 0.6 which indicates that the research data used in testing player experience is considered reliable so that it can be used to provide input for future Alas Tilas game development. To increase the average score, the researcher provides recommendations for improvement, namely adjusting the Accuracy and Novelty aspects of the horror scenario game entitled Alas Tilas East Java. So that it is expected to improve the quality of the game. "}
