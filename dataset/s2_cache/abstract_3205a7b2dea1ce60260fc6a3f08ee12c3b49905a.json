{"abstract":"How to effectively improve the efficiency of vehicle traffic in the road system will play an essential role in improving the operational efficiency of the traffic system while eliminating the energy consumption and environmental pollution problems caused in particular, and this is also a key concern in the field of intelligent transportation systems. Timely and accurate traffic flow prediction is regarded as the key to solve the above problems because it can effectively improve the efficiency of traffic flow management. Many prediction methods have been proposed and among them, Machine Learning (ML)-based forecasting methods have gradually become mainstream in recent years because of their inherent ability to learn and predict nonlinear features in traffic information. However, we notice that most of the existing ML-based traffic prediction methods were designed relying fully on historical data while ignoring the structure and the impacts of the whole road network. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a mixed method to take both historical data and road networks into consideration. Based on the real-world dataset, we conducted simulation experiments. The corresponding test results demonstrate a substantial improvement in the prediction accuracy of our method compared to conventional ML-based methods."}
