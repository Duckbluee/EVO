{"abstract":"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown huge potentials in building financial market simulators recently. However, due to the highly complex and dynamic nature of real-world markets, raw historical financial data often involve large noise and may not reflect the future of markets, degrading the fidelity of DRL-based market simulators. Moreover, the accuracy of DRL-based market simulators heavily relies on numerous and diverse DRL agents, which increases demand for a universe of market environments and imposes a challenge on simulation speed. In this paper, we present a FinRL-Meta framework that builds a universe of market environments for data-driven financial reinforcement learning. First, FinRL-Meta separates financial data processing from the design pipeline of DRL-based strategy and provides open-source data engineering tools for financial big data. Second, FinRL-Meta provides hundreds of market environments for various trading tasks. Third, FinRL-Meta enables multiprocessing simulation and training by exploiting thousands of GPU cores.
