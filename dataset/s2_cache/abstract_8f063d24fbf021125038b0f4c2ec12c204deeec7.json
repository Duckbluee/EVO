{"abstract":"Grammatical error correction is a key challenge in natural language processing research, driving advancements in language processing. It ensures accuracy and polish in written content for authors and creators across domains. In this paper, we evaluate datasets focused on grammatical error correction in the Slovak language using the Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer model. We have outlined significant studies within the realm of natural language processing, as well as the utilization of the T5 model in related research. In our experimental approach, we employed two datasets sourced from various online platforms. Our endeavors yielded remarkable outcomes both within this domain and specifically for the Slovak language."}
