{"abstract":"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has attracted increasing attention in recent years, which adapts classifiers to an unlabeled target domain by exploiting a labeled source domain. To reduce the discrepancy between source and target domains, adversarial learning methods are typically selected to seek domain-invariant representations by confusing the domain discriminator. However, classifiers may not be well adapted to such a domain-invariant representation space, as the sample- and class-level data structures could be distorted during adversarial learning. In this article, we propose a novel transferable feature learning approach on graphs (TFLG) for unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation (DA), which jointly incorporates sample- and class-level structure information across two domains. TFLG first constructs graphs for minibatch samples and identifies the classwise correspondence across domains. A novel cross-domain graph convolutional operation is designed to jointly align the sample- and class-level structures in two domains. Moreover, a memory bank is designed to further exploit the class-level information. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art UDA methods."}
