{"abstract":"Post-quantum cryptography represents a category of cryptosystems resistant to quantum algorithms. Such schemes are under the scrutiny of their mathematical security in the context of the NIST standardization process, but they are not side-channel secure at the algorithm level. That is why their side-channel vulnerabilities must be assessed by the research community. In this paper, we present a non-profiled correlation electromagnetic analysis against an FPGA implementation of the standard key-encapsulation mechanism, CRYSTALS-Kyber. The attack correlates an electromagnetic radiation model of the polynomial multiplication execution with the captured traces. With 166,620 traces, this attack correctly recovers 100% of the subkeys. Furthermore, a countermeasure is presented for securing the target implementation against the presented attack."}
