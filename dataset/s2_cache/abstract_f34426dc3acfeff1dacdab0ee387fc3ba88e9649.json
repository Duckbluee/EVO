{"abstract":"Federated learning (FL) is a technique that involves multiple participants who update their local models with private data and aggregate these models using a central server. Unfortunately, central servers are prone to single-point failures during the aggregation process, which leads to data leakage and other problems. Although many studies have shown that a blockchain can solve the single-point failure of servers, blockchains cannot identify or mitigate the effect of backdoor attacks. Therefore, this paper proposes a blockchain-based FL framework for defense against backdoor attacks. The framework utilizes blockchains to record transactions in an immutable distributed ledger network and enables decentralized FL. Furthermore, by incorporating the reverse layer-wise relevance (RLR) aggregation strategy into the participant’s aggregation algorithm and adding gradient noise to limit the effectiveness of backdoor attacks, the accuracy of backdoor attacks is substantially reduced. Furthermore, we designed a new proof-of-stake mechanism that considers the historical stakes of participants and the accuracy for selecting the miners of the local model, thereby reducing the stake rewards of malicious participants and motivating them to upload honest model parameters. Our simulation results confirm that, for 10% of malicious participants, the success rate of backdoor injection is reduced by nearly 90% compared to Vanilla FL, and the stake income of malicious devices is the lowest."}
