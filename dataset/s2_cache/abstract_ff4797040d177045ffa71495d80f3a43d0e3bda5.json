{"abstract":"This paper proposes a technique to estimate the distance between an object and a rolling shutter camera using a single image. The implementation of this technique uses the principle of the rolling shutter effect (RSE), a distortion within the rolling-shutter-type camera. The proposed technique has a mathematical strength compared to other single photo-based distance estimation methods that do not consider the geometric arrangement. The relationship between the distance and RSE angle was derived using the camera parameters (focal length, shutter speed, image size, etc.). Mathematical equations were derived for three different scenarios. The mathematical model was verified through experiments using a Nikon D750 and Nikkor 50 mm lens mounted on a car with varying speeds, object distances, and camera parameters. The results show that the mathematical model provides an accurate distance estimation of an object. The distance estimation error using the RSE due to the change in speed remained stable at approximately 10 cm. However, when the distance between the object and camera was more than 10 m, the estimated distance was sensitive to the RSE and the error increased dramatically."}
