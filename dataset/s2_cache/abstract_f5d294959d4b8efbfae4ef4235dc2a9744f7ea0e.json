{"abstract":"Large-scale cropping (LSC) is one of the mostly-used operations in desynchronization attacks and can easily destroy the watermark information by deleting continuous audio slices from the watermarked audio. In this work, we propose a spread spectrum (SS) based audio watermarking scheme to resist against LSC attacks more robustly from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Specifically, we first perform discrete wavelet transform (DWT), graph-based transform (GBT), and singular value decomposition (SVD) on the host audio signal to produce transform coefficients. Next, we embed the chaotic encrypted watermark into DWT-GBT-SVD coefficients by the SS technique. Then, we combine m-sequences with the encrypted watermark to generate the watermarking key, which can theoretically guarantee the self-restoration of the cropped watermark based on the periodicity of m-sequences. Additionally, we develop an effective sliding window (SW) strategy to extract the fragmentary watermark slices from DWT-GBT-SVD coefficients and restore the integral watermark by the watermarking key. Finally, the proposed audio watermarking scheme, named m-SW-LSC, is compared with the state-of-the-art audio watermarking methods on audio signals with different genres and lengths under various attacks with different ratios. Experimental results demonstrate that our m-SW-LSC has a superior performance in restoring the complete watermark and exhibits significantly high robustness against LSC attacks."}
