{"abstract":"We present GR-2, a state-of-the-art generalist robot agent for versatile and generalizable robot manipulation. GR-2 is first pre-trained on a vast number of Internet videos to capture the dynamics of the world. This large-scale pre-training, involving 38 million video clips and over 50 billion tokens, equips GR-2 with the ability to generalize across a wide range of robotic tasks and environments during subsequent policy learning. Following this, GR-2 is fine-tuned for both video generation and action prediction using robot trajectories. It exhibits impressive multi-task learning capabilities, achieving an average success rate of 97.7% across more than 100 tasks. Moreover, GR-2 demonstrates exceptional generalization to new, previously unseen scenarios, including novel backgrounds, environments, objects, and tasks. Notably, GR-2 scales effectively with model size, underscoring its potential for continued growth and application. Project page: \\url{https://gr2-manipulation.github.io}."}
