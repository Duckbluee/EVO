{"abstract":"The society’s insatiable appetites for personal data are driving the emergence of data markets, allowing data consumers to launch customized queries over the datasets collected by a data broker from data owners. In this paper, we study how the data broker can maximize its cumulative revenue by posting reasonable prices for sequential queries. We thus propose a contextual dynamic pricing mechanism with the reserve price constraint, which features the properties of ellipsoid for efficient online optimization and can support linear and non-linear market value models with uncertainty. In particular, under low uncertainty, the proposed pricing mechanism attains a worst-case cumulative regret logarithmic in the number of queries. We further extend our approach to support other similar application scenarios, including hospitality service and online advertising, and extensively evaluate all three use cases over MovieLens 20M dataset, Airbnb listings in U.S. major cities, and Avazu mobile ad click dataset, respectively. The analysis and evaluation results reveal that: (1) our pricing mechanism incurs low practical regret, while the latency and memory overhead incurred is low enough for online applications; and (2) the existence of reserve price can mitigate the cold-start problem in a posted price mechanism, thereby reducing the cumulative regret."}
