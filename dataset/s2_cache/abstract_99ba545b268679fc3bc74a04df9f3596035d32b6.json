{"abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) has a huge impact on our personal lives and also on our democratic society as a whole. While AI offers vast opportunities for the benefit of people, its potential to embed and perpetuate bias and discrimination remains one of the most pressing challenges deriving from its increasing use. This new study, which was prepared by Prof. Frederik Zuiderveen Borgesius for the Anti-discrimination Department of the Council of Europe, elaborates on the risks of discrimination caused by algorithmic decision-making and other types of artificial intelligence (AI)."}
