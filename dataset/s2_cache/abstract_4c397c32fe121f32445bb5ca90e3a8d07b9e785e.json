{"abstract":"Dubbed “the successor to the mobile Internet,” the concept of the Metaverse has grown in popularity. While there exist lite versions of the Metaverse today, they are still far from realizing the full vision of an immersive, embodied, and interoperable Metaverse. Without addressing the issues of implementation from the communication and networking, as well as computation perspectives, the Metaverse is difficult to succeed the Internet, especially in terms of its accessibility to billions of users today. In this survey, we focus on the edge-enabled Metaverse to realize its ultimate vision. We first provide readers with a succinct tutorial of the Metaverse, an introduction to the architecture, as well as current developments. To enable ubiquitous, seamless, and embodied access to the Metaverse, we discuss the communication and networking challenges and survey cutting-edge solutions and concepts that leverage next-generation communication systems for users to immerse as and interact with embodied avatars in the Metaverse. Moreover, given the high computation costs required, e.g., to render 3D virtual worlds and run data-hungry artificial intelligence-driven avatars, we discuss the computation challenges and cloud-edge-end computation framework-driven solutions to realize the Metaverse on resource-constrained edge devices. Next, we explore how blockchain technologies can aid in the interoperable development of the Metaverse, not just in terms of empowering the economic circulation of virtual user-generated content but also to manage physical edge resources in a decentralized, transparent, and immutable manner. Finally, we discuss the future research directions towards realizing the true vision of the edge-enabled Metaverse."}
