{"abstract":"In the task of image captioning, a natural language explanation is generated for a given image. It uses the subfields of artificial intelligence: computer vision and language generation. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is generally applied to capture image features and language processing models such as Recurrent Neural Network for sentence generation. In this paper, various datasets and evaluation metrics which are useful for image captioning task are discussed. Also, the datasets and evaluation metrics applied by the state-of-the-art image captioning models is summarized."}
