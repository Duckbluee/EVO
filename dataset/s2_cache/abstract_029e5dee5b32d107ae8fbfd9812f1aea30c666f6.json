{"abstract":". Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) is a fundamental aspect of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that allows for the conversion of lengthy text documents into concise summaries that retain the essential information based on specific criteria. In this paper, we present a literature review on the topic of ATS, which includes an overview of the various approaches to ATS, categorized by the mechanisms they use to generate a summary. By organizing these approaches based on their underlying mechanisms, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state-of-the-art in ATS systems"}
