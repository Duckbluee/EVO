{"abstract":"The recent development of generative models unleashes the potential of generating hyper-realistic fake images. To prevent the malicious usage of fake images, AI-generated image detection aims to distinguish fake images from real images. However, existing method suffer from severe performance drop when detecting images generated by unseen generators. We find that generative models tend to focus on generating the patches with rich textures to make the images more realistic while neglecting the hidden noise caused by camera capture present in simple patches. In this paper, we propose to exploit the noise pattern of a single simple patch to identify fake images. Furthermore, due to the performance decline when handling low-quality generated images, we introduce an enhancement module and a perception module to remove the interfering information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks."}
