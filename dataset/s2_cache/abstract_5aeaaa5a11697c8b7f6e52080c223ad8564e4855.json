{"abstract":"Inverse kinematic equations allow the determination of the joint angles necessary for the robotic manipulator to place a tool into a predefined position. Determining this equation is vital but a complex work. In this article, an artificial neural network, more specifically, a feed-forward type, multilayer perceptron (MLP), is trained, so that it could be used to calculate the inverse kinematics for a robotic manipulator. First, direct kinematics of a robotic manipulator are determined using Denavit–Hartenberg method and a dataset of 15,000 points is generated using the calculated homogenous transformation matrices. Following that, multiple MLPs are trained with 10,240 different hyperparameter combinations to find the best. Each trained MLP is evaluated using the R 2 and mean absolute error metrics and the architectures of the MLPs that achieved the best results are presented. Results show a successful regression for the first five joints (percentage error being less than 0.1%) but a comparatively poor regression for the final joint due to the configuration of the robotic manipulator."}
