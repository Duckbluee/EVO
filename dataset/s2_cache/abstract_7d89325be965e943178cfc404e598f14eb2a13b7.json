{"abstract":"Virtual reality (VR) over wireless is expected to be one of the killer applications in next-generation communication networks. Nevertheless, the huge data volume along with stringent requirements on latency and reliability under limited bandwidth resources makes untethered wireless VR delivery increasingly challenging. Such bottlenecks, therefore, motivate this work to seek the potential of using semantic communication, a new paradigm that promises to significantly ease the resource pressure, for efficient VR delivery. To this end, we propose a novel framework, namely Wireless Semantic delivery for VR (WiserVR), for delivering consecutive 360° video frames to VR users. Specifically, multiple deep learning-based modules are well-devised for the transceiver in WiserVR to realize high-performance feature extraction and semantic recovery. Among them, we dedicatedly develop a concept of semantic location graph and leverage the joint-semantic-channel-coding method with knowledge sharing to not only substantially reduce communication latency, but also to guaran-tee adequate transmission reliability and resilience under various channel states. Moreover, imple-mentation of WiserVR is presented, followed by corresponding initial simulations for performance evaluation compared with benchmarks. Finally, we discuss several open issues and offer feasible solutions to unlock the full potential of WiserVR."}
