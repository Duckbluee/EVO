{"abstract":"Cluster analysis plays an indispensable role in machine learning and data mining. Learning a good data representation is crucial for clustering algorithms. Recently, deep clustering (DC), which can learn clustering-friendly representations using deep neural networks (DNNs), has been broadly applied in a wide range of clustering tasks. Existing surveys for DC mainly focus on the single-view fields and the network architectures, ignoring the complex application scenarios of clustering. To address this issue, in this article, we provide a comprehensive survey for DC in views of data sources. With different data sources, we systematically distinguish the clustering methods in terms of methodology, prior knowledge, and architecture. Concretely, DC methods are introduced according to four categories, i.e., traditional single-view DC, semi-supervised DC, deep multiview clustering (MVC), and deep transfer clustering. Finally, we discuss the open challenges and potential future opportunities in different fields of DC."}
