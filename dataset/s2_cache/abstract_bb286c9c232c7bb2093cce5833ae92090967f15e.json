{"abstract":"Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize classes that do not have samples in the training set. One representative solution is to directly learn an embedding function associating visual features with corresponding class semantics for recognizing new classes. Many methods extend upon this solution, and recent ones are especially keen on extracting rich features from images, e.g., attribute features. These attribute features are normally extracted within each individual image; however, the common traits for features across images yet belonging to the same attribute are not emphasized. In this article, we propose a new framework to boost ZSL by explicitly learning attribute prototypes beyond images and contrastively optimizing them with attribute-level features within images. Besides the novel architecture, two elements are highlighted for attribute representations: a new prototype generation module (PM) is designed to generate attribute prototypes from attribute semantics; a hard-example-based contrastive optimization scheme is introduced to reinforce attribute-level features in the embedding space. We explore two alternative backbones, CNN-based and transformer-based, to build our framework and conduct experiments on three standard benchmarks, Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB), SUN attribute database (SUN), and animals with attributes 2 (AwA2). Results on these benchmarks demonstrate that our method improves the state of the art by a considerable margin. Our codes will be available at https://github.com/dyabel/CoAR-ZSL.git."}
