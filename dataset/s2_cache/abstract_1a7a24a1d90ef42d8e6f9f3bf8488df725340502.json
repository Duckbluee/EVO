{"abstract":"A diagramming method called Propositional Constraint (PC) graphing was developed as an aid for tasks involving argumentation, planning, and design. Motivated by several AI models of defeasible (or non- monotonic) reasoning, PC graphs were designed to represent knowledge according to an analogical framework in which constraints (e.g., evidence, goals, system constraints) may elicit or deny possibilities (e.g., explanations, decisions, behaviors). In cases of underspecification, an absence of constraints yields uncertainty and competition among plausible outcomes. In cases of overspecification, no plausible outcome is yielded until one of the constraints is amended or forfeited. This framework shares features with theoretical models of reasoning and argumentation, but despite its intuitiveness and applicability, we know of no modeling language or graphical aid that explicitly depicts this defeasible constraint structure. We describe the syntax and semantics for PC graphing and then illustrate potential uses for it."}
