{"abstract":"In recent years, the background-aware correlation filters have achie-ved a lot of research interest in the visual target tracking. However, these methods cannot suitably model the target appearance due to the exploitation of hand-crafted features. On the other hand, the recent deep learning-based visual tracking methods have provided a competitive performance along with extensive computations. In this paper, an adaptive background-aware correlation filter-based tracker is proposed that effectively models the target appearance by using either the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) or convolutional neural network (CNN) feature maps. The proposed method exploits the fast 2D non-maximum suppression (NMS) algorithm and the semantic information comparison to detect challenging situations. When the HOG-based response map is not reliable, or the context region has a low semantic similarity with prior regions, the proposed method constructs the CNN context model to improve the target region estimation. Furthermore, the rejection option allows the proposed method to update the CNN context model only on valid regions. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive method clearly outperforms the accuracy and robustness of visual target tracking compared to the state-of-the-art methods on the OTB-50, OTB-100, TC-128, UAV-123, and VOT-2015 datasets."}
