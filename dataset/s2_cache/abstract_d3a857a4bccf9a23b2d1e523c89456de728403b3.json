{"abstract":"Deep learning bears promise for drug discovery, including advanced image analysis, prediction of molecular structure and function, and automated generation of innovative chemical entities with bespoke properties. Despite the growing number of successful prospective applications, the underlying mathematical models often remain elusive to interpretation by the human mind. There is a demand for ‘explainable’ deep learning methods to address the need for a new narrative of the machine language of the molecular sciences. This Review summarizes the most prominent algorithmic concepts of explainable artificial intelligence, and forecasts future opportunities, potential applications as well as several remaining challenges. We also hope it encourages additional efforts towards the development and acceptance of explainable artificial intelligence techniques. Drug discovery has recently profited greatly from the use of deep learning models. However, these models can be notoriously hard to interpret. In this Review, Jiménez-Luna and colleagues summarize recent approaches to use explainable artificial intelligence techniques in drug discovery."}
