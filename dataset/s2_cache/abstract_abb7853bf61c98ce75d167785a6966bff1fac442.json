{"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a general framework for incomplete multiview clustering. The proposed method is the first work that exploits the graph learning and spectral clustering techniques to learn the common representation for incomplete multiview clustering. First, owing to the good performance of low-rank representation in discovering the intrinsic subspace structure of data, we adopt it to adaptively construct the graph of each view. Second, a spectral constraint is used to achieve the low-dimensional representation of each view based on the spectral clustering. Third, we further introduce a co-regularization term to learn the common representation of samples for all views, and then use the ${k}$ -means to partition the data into their respective groups. An efficient iterative algorithm is provided to optimize the model. Experimental results conducted on seven incomplete multiview datasets show that the proposed method achieves the best performance in comparison with some state-of-the-art methods, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed method in incomplete multiview clustering."}
