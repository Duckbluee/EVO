{"abstract":"Many distributed applications adopt a partition/aggregation pattern to achieve high performance and scalability. The aggregation process, which usually takes a large portion of the overall execution time, incurs large amount of network traffic and bottlenecks the system performance. To reduce network traffic, some researches take advantage of network devices to commit innetwork aggregation. However, these approaches use either special topology or middle-boxes, which cannot be easily deployed in current datacenters. The emerging programmable RMT switch brings us new opportunities to implement in-network computation task. However, we argue that the architecture of RMT switch is not suitable for in-network aggregation since it is designed primarily for implementing traditional network functions. In this paper, we first give a detailed analysis of in-network aggregation, and point out the key factor that affects the data reduction ratio. We then propose SwitchAgg, which is an innetwork aggregation system that is compatible with current datacenter infrastructures. We also evaluate the performance improvement we have gained from SwitchAgg. Our results show that, SwitchAgg can process data aggregation tasks at line rate and gives a high data reduction rate, which helps us to cut down network traffic and alleviate pressure on server CPU. In the system performance test, the job-completion-time can be reduced as much as 50%."}
