{"abstract":"Being more powerful and intrusive into user-device interactions, LLMs are eager for on-device execution to better preserve user privacy. In this work, we propose a new paradigm of mobile AI: LLM as a system service on mobile devices (LLMaaS). Unlike traditional DNNs that execute in a stateless manner, such a system service is stateful: LLMs execution often needs to maintain persistent states (mainly KV cache) across multiple invocations. To minimize the LLM context switching overhead under tight device memory budget, this work presents LLMS, which decouples the memory management of app and LLM contexts with a key idea of fine-grained, chunk-wise, globally-optimized KV cache compression and swapping. By fully leveraging KV cache's unique characteristics, it proposes three novel techniques: (1) Tolerance-Aware Compression: it compresses chunks based on their measured accuracy tolerance to compression. (2) IO-Recompute Pipelined Loading: it introduces recompute to swapping-in for acceleration. (3) Chunk Lifecycle Management: it optimizes the memory activities of chunks with an ahead-of-time swapping-out and an LCTRU (Least Compression-Tolerable and Recently-Used) queue based eviction. In evaluations conducted on well-established traces and various edge devices, \\sys reduces context switching latency by up to 2 orders of magnitude when compared to competitive baseline solutions."}
