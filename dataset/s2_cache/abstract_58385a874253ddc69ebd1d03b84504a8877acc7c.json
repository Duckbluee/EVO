{"abstract":"This paper considers the resilient consensus in multi-dimensional spaces, where some of the agents might be misbehaving. Despite the influence of network misbehaviors, the normal agents aim to reach an agreement within the convex hull of their initial states. In particular, an Event-based Safe Kernel (E-SK) protocol is developed in this paper, which increases the network resilience while saves its communication costs. In the algorithm, each normal agent computes a \"safe kernel\" based on its neighboring information, and updates its state towards a point inside this kernel at every step. With the event-based mechanism, the updated state would be sent to its neighbors only when it sufficiently changes since the last transmission. Assuming the number of malicious nodes is upper bounded, we provide sufficient topological conditions for E-SK to guarantee the resilient consensus while reducing the unnecessary communications. Numerical examples are provided in the end to validate the theoretical results."}
