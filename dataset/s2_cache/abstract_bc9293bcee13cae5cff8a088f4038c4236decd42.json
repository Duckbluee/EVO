{"abstract":"The detection of anomalous executions is valuable for reducing potential hazards in assistive manipulation. Multimodal sensory signals can be helpful for detecting a wide range of anomalies. However, the fusion of high-dimensional and heterogeneous modalities is a challenging problem for model-based anomaly detection. We introduce a long short-term memory-based variational autoencoder (LSTM-VAE) that fuses signals and reconstructs their expected distribution by introducing a progress-based varying prior. Our LSTM-VAE-based detector reports an anomaly when a reconstruction-based anomaly score is higher than a state-based threshold. For evaluations with 1555 robot-assisted feeding executions, including 12 representative types of anomalies, our detector had a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.8710 than 5 other baseline detectors from the literature. We also show the variational autoencoding and state-based thresholding are effective in detecting anomalies from 17 raw sensory signals without significant feature engineering effort."}
