{"abstract":"Wireless sensor network has been widely used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications to support large and dense networks. As sensor nodes are usually tiny and provided with limited hardware resources, the existing multiple access methods, which involve high computational complexity to preserve the protocol performance, is not available under such a scenario. In this paper, we propose an intelligent Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol selection scheme based on machine learning in wireless sensor networks. We jointly consider the impact of inherent behavior and external environments to deal with the application limitation problem of the single type MAC protocol. This scheme can benefit from the combination of the competitive protocols and non-competitive protocols, and help the network nodes to select the MAC protocol that best suits the current network condition. Extensive simulation results validate our work, and it also proven that the accuracy of the proposed MAC protocol selection strategy is higher than the existing work."}
