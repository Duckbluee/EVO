{"abstract":"Frequent pattern mining is an important class of knowledge discovery problems. It aims at finding out high-frequency items or structures (e.g., itemset, sequence) in a database, and plays an essential role in deriving other interesting patterns, like association rules. The traditional approach of gathering data to a central server and analyze is no longer viable due to the increasing awareness of user privacy and newly established laws on data protection. Previous privacy-preserving frequent pattern mining approaches only target a particular problem with great utility loss when handling complex structures. In this paper, we take the first initiative to propose a unified federated analytics framework (FedFPM) for a variety of frequent pattern mining problems, including item, itemset, and sequence mining. FedFPM achieves high data utility and guarantees local differential privacy without uploading raw data. Specifically, FedFPM adopts an interactive query-response approach between clients and a server. The server meticulously employs the Apriori property and the Hoeffding’s inequality to generates informed queries. The clients randomize their responses in the reduced space to realize local differential privacy. Experiments on three different frequent pattern mining tasks demonstrate that FedFPM achieves better performances than the state-of-the-art specialized benchmarks, with a much smaller computation overhead."}
