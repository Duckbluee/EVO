{"abstract":"This paper summarizes eight types of error of terminology in the patent text in the output of Machine Translation from English into Chinese, including term being mistranslated as a verb, term being mistranslated as a common noun, term being redundantly translated, term being mistranslated as a homophone, term being mistranslated as a wrong term, term being mistranslated due to Chinese expression, term being mistranslated without initial, and term being mistranslated due to wrong acronym. These errors can be solved by the translator before Machine Translation and the translator can identify and correct these errors by pre-editing of the source text."}
