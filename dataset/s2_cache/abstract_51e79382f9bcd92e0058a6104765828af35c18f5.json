{"abstract":"We present STADEE, a \\textbf{STA}tistics-based \\textbf{DEE}p detection method to identify machine-generated text, addressing the limitations of current methods that rely heavily on fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs). STADEE integrates key statistical text features with a deep classifier, focusing on aspects like token probability and cumulative probability, crucial for handling nucleus sampling. Tested across diverse datasets and scenarios (in-domain, out-of-domain, and in-the-wild), STADEE demonstrates superior performance, achieving an 87.05% F1 score in-domain and outperforming both traditional statistical methods and fine-tuned PLMs, especially in out-of-domain and in-the-wild settings, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability."}
