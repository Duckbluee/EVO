{"abstract":"Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing our daily life in many application fields. Automatic trading has inspired a large number of field experts and scientists in developing innovative techniques and deploying cutting-edge technologies to trade different markets. In this context, cryptocurrency has given new interest in the application of AI techniques for predicting the future price of a financial asset. In this work Deep Reinforcement Learning is applied to trade bitcoin. More precisely, Double and Dueling Double Deep Q-learning Networks are compared over a period of almost four years. Two reward functions are also tested: Sharpe ratio and profit reward functions. The Double Deep Q-learning trading system based on Sharpe ratio reward function demonstrated to be the most profitable approach for trading bitcoin."}
