{"abstract":"Thanks to the publication of ChatGPT, Artificial Intelligence is now basically accessible and usable to all internet users. The technology behind it can be used in many chatbots, whereby the chatbots should be trained for the respective area of application. Depending on the application, the chatbot should react differently and thus, for example, also take on and embody personality traits to be able to help and answer people better and more personally. This raises the question of whether ChatGPT-4 is able to embody personality traits. Our study investigated whether ChatGPT-4’s personality can be analyzed using personality tests for humans. To test possible approaches to measuring the personality traits of ChatGPT-4, experiments were conducted with two of the most well-known personality tests: the Big Five and Myers–Briggs. The experiments also examine whether and how personality can be changed by user input and what influence this has on the results of the personality tests."}
