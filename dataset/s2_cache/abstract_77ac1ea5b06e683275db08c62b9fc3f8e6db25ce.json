{"abstract":"Object detection in 3D point clouds is still a challenging task in autonomous driving. Due to the inherent occlusion and density changes of the point cloud, the data distribution of the same object will change dramatically. Especially, the incomplete data with sparsity or occlusion can not represent the complete characteristics of the object. In this paper, we proposed a novel strong–weak feature alignment algorithm between complete and incomplete objects for 3D object detection, which explores the correlations within the data. It is an end-to-end adaptive network that does not require additional data and can be easily applied to other object detection networks. Through a complete object feature extractor, we achieve a robust feature representation of the object. It serves as a guarding feature to help the incomplete object feature generator to generate effective features. The strong–weak feature alignment algorithm reduces the gap between different states of the same object and enhances the ability to represent the incomplete object. The proposed adaptation framework is validated on the KITTI object benchmark and gets about 6% improvement in detection average precision on 3D moderate difficulty compared to the basic model. The results show that our adaptation method improves the detection performance of incomplete 3D objects."}
