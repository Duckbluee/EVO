{"abstract":"Human education system trains one student by multiple experts. Mixture-of-experts (MoE) is a powerful sparse architecture including multiple experts. However, sparse MoE model is easy to overfit, hard to deploy, and not hardware-friendly for practitioners. In this work, inspired by the human education model, we propose a novel task, knowledge integration, to obtain a dense student model (OneS) as knowledgeable as one sparse MoE. We investigate this task by proposing a general training framework including knowledge gathering and knowledge distillation. Specifically, to gather key knowledge from different pre-trained experts, we first investigate four different possible knowledge gathering methods, \\ie summation, averaging, Top-K Knowledge Gathering (Top-KG), and Singular Value Decomposition Knowledge Gathering (SVD-KG) proposed in this paper. We then refine the dense student model by knowledge distillation to offset the noise from gathering. On ImageNet, our OneS preserves $61.7\\%$ benefits from MoE and achieves $78.4\\%$ top-1 accuracy ImageNet with only $15$M parameters. On four natural language processing datasets, OneS obtains $88.2\\%$ MoE benefits and outperforms the best baseline by $51.7\\%$ using the same architecture and training data. In addition, compared with the MoE counterpart, OneS can achieve $3.7 \\times$ inference speedup due to less computation and hardware-friendly architecture."}
