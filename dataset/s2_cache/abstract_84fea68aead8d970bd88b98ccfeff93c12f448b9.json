{"abstract":"Document-level sentiment analysis is a challenging task given the large size of the text, which leads to an abundance of words and opinions, at times contradictory, in the same document. This analysis is particularly useful in analyzing press articles and blog posts about a particular product or company, and it requires a high concentration, especially when the topic being discussed is sensitive. Nevertheless, most existing models and techniques are designed to process short text from social networks and collaborative platforms. In this paper, we propose a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) models, with Doc2vec embedding, suitable for opinion analysis in long texts. The CNN-BiLSTM model is compared with CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM and CNN-LSTM models with Word2vec/Doc2vec embeddings. The Doc2vec with CNN-BiLSTM model was applied on French newspapers articles and outperformed the other models with 90.66% accuracy."}
