{"abstract":"While several researchers have published bug data sets in the past, there has been less focus on bugs related to non-functional requirements. Non-functional requirements describe the quality attributes of a program. In this work, we introduce NFBugs, a data set of 133 non-functional bug fixes collected from 65 open-source projects written in Java and Python. NFBugs can be used to support code recommender systems focusing on non-functional properties."}
