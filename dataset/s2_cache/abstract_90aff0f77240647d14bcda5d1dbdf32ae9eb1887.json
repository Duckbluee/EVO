{"abstract":"Federated learning is an emerging machine learning framework where models are trained using heterogeneous datasets collected by a large number of edge clients. Standard methods to aggregate local training models weigh each model by a fraction of data size at that client. However, such approaches result in unfairness to clients with small and unique datasets, leading to inferior accuracy of the global model at these clients. In this work, we propose a novel optimization framework called DRFL that dynamically adjusts the weight assigned to each client, and we combine it with a biased client selection strategy, both of which encourage fairness in federated training. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed method on a suite of both synthetic and real federated datasets, revealing the proposed method outperforms existing baselines in terms of resulting fairness."}
