{"abstract":"Few-shot relation reasoning on knowledge graphs (FS-KGR) is an important and practical problem that aims to infer long-tail relations and has drawn increasing attention these years. Among all the proposed methods, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, which effectively extract the hidden essential inductive patterns relying only on the support sets, have achieved promising performance. However, the existing SSL methods simply cut down connections between high-frequency and long-tail relations, which ignores the fact, i.e., the two kinds of information could be highly related to each other. Specifically, we observe that relations with similar contextual meanings, called aliasing relations (ARs), may have similar attributes. In other words, the ARs of the target long-tail relation could be in high-frequency, and leveraging such attributes can largely improve the reasoning performance. Based on the interesting observation above, we proposed a novel Self-supervised learning model by leveraging Aliasing Relations to assist FS-KGR, termed SARF. Specifically, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based AR-assist module to encode the ARs. Besides, we further provide two fusion strategies, i.e., simple summation and learnable fusion, to fuse the generated representations, which contain extra abundant information underlying the ARs, into the self-supervised reasoning backbone for performance enhancement. Extensive experiments on three few-shot benchmarks demonstrate that SARF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared with other methods in most cases."}
