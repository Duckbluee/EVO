{"abstract":"Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to localize abnormal events on the timeline of long-range surveillance videos. Anomaly-scoring-based methods have been prevailing for years but suffer from the high complexity of thresholding and low explanability of detection results. In this paper, we conduct pioneer research on equipping video-based large language models (VLLMs) in the framework of VAD, making the VAD model free from thresholds and able to explain the reasons for the detected anomalies. We introduce a novel network module Long-Term Context (LTC) to mitigate the incapability of VLLMs in long-range context modeling. We design a three-phase training method to improve the efficiency of fine-tuning VLLMs by substantially minimizing the requirements for VAD data and lowering the costs of annotating instruction-tuning data. Our trained model achieves the top performance on the anomaly videos of the UCF-Crime and TAD benchmarks, with the AUC improvements of +3.86\\% and +4.96\\%, respectively. More impressively, our approach can provide textual explanations for detected anomalies."}
