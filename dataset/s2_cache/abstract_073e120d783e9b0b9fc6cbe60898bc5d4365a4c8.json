{"abstract":"Misinformation has been a persistent and harmful phenomenon affecting our society in various ways, including individuals' physical health and economic stability. With the rise of short video platforms and related applications, the spread of multi-modal misinformation, encompassing images, texts, audios, and videos have exacerbated these concerns. The introduction of generative AI models like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion has further complicated matters, giving rise to Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) and presenting new challenges in detecting and mitigating misinformation. Consequently, traditional approaches to misinformation detection and intervention have become inadequate in this evolving landscape. This paper explores the challenges posed by AIGC in the context of misinformation. It examines the issue from psychological and societal perspectives, and explores the subtle manipulation traces found in AIGC at signal, perceptual, semantic, and human levels. By scrutinizing manipulation traces such as signal manipulation, semantic inconsistencies, logical incoherence, and psychological strategies, our objective is to tackle AI-generated misinformation and provide a conceptual design of systematic explainable solution. Ultimately, we aim for this paper to contribute valuable insights into combating misinformation, particularly in the era of AIGC."}
