{"abstract":"Given the increased interest in utilizing artificial intelligence as an assistive tool in the medical sector, colorectal polyp detection and classification using deep learning techniques has been an active area of research in recent years. The motivation for researching this topic is that physicians miss polyps from time to time due to fatigue and lack of experience carrying out the procedure. Unidentified polyps can cause further complications and ultimately lead to colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the leading causes of cancer mortality. Although various techniques have been presented recently, several key issues, such as the lack of enough training data, white light reflection, and blur affect the performance of such methods. This paper presents a survey on recently proposed methods for detecting polyps from colonoscopy. The survey covers benchmark dataset analysis, evaluation metrics, common challenges, standard methods of building polyp detectors and a review of the latest work in the literature. We conclude this paper by providing a precise analysis of the gaps and trends discovered in the reviewed literature for future work."}
