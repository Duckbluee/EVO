{"abstract":"We consider federated edge learning (FEEL), where mobile users (MUs) collaboratively learn a global model by sharing local updates on the model parameters rather than their datasets, with the help of a mobile base station (MBS). We optimize the resource allocation among MUs to reduce the communication latency in learning iterations. Observing that the performance in this centralized setting is limited due to the distance of the cell-edge users to the MBS, we introduce small cell base stations (SBSs) orchestrating FEEL among MUs within their cells, and periodically exchanging model updates with the MBS for global consensus. We show that this hierarchical federated learning (HFL) scheme significantly reduces the communication latency without sacrificing the accuracy."}
