{"abstract":"In this chapter a case is made for six implicationally related cognitive statuses relevant for explicating the use of referring expressions in natural language discourse. These statuses are the conventional meanings signaled by determiners and pronouns, and interaction of the statuses with general conversational principles such as Grice’s Maxim of Quantity accounts for the actual distribution and interpretation of forms when necessary conditions for the use of more than one form are met. This proposal is supported by an empirical study of the distribution of referring expressions in naturally occurring discourse in five languages: English, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Spanish."}
