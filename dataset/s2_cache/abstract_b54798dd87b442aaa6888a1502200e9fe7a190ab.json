{"abstract":"We study the problem of learning to perform multistage robotic manipulation tasks, with applications to cable routing, where the robot must route a cable through a series of clips. This setting presents challenges representative of complex multistage robotic manipulation scenarios: handling deformable objects, closing the loop on visual perception, and handling extended behaviors consisting of multiple steps that must be executed successfully to complete the entire task. In such settings, learning individual primitives for each stage that succeed with a high enough rate to perform a complete temporally extended task is impractical: if each stage must be completed successfully and has a nonnegligible probability of failure, the likelihood of successful completion of the entire task becomes negligible. Therefore, successful controllers for such multistage tasks must be able to recover from failure and compensate for imperfections in low-level controllers by smartly choosing which controllers to trigger at any given time, retrying, or taking corrective action as needed. To this end, we describe an imitation learning system that uses vision-based policies trained from demonstrations at both the lower (motor control) and the upper (sequencing) level, present a system for instantiating this method to learn the cable routing task, and perform evaluations showing great performance in generalizing to very challenging clip placement variations."}
