{"abstract":"Graph anomaly detection is attracting remarkable multidisciplinary research interests ranging from finance, healthcare, and social network analysis. Recent advances on graph neural networks have substantially improved the detection performance via semi-supervised representation learning. However, prior work suggests that deep graph-based methods tend to learn spurious correlations. As a result, they fail to generalize beyond training data distribution. In this article, we aim to identify structural and contextual anomaly nodes in an attributed graph. Based on our preliminary data analyses, spurious correlations can be eliminated with causal subgraph interventions. Therefore, we propose a new graph-based anomaly detection model that can learn causal relations for anomaly detection while generalizing to new environments. To handle situations with varying environments, we steer the generative model to manufacture synthetic environment features, which are exerted on realistic subgraphs to generate counterfactual subgraphs. Further, these counterfactual subgraphs help a few-shot anomaly detection model learn transferable and causal relations across different environments. The experiments on three real-world attributed graphs show that the proposed approach achieves the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art baselines and learns robust causal representations resistant to noises and spurious correlations."}
