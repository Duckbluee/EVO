{"abstract":"Background: Tumor segmentation in MRI is crucial in radiotherapy (RT) treatment planning for brain tumor patients. Segment anything (SA), a novel promptable foundation model for autosegmentation, has shown high accuracy for multiple segmentation tasks but was not evaluated on medical datasets yet. Methods: SA was evaluated in a point-to-mask task for glioma brain tumor autosegmentation on 16744 transversal slices from 369 MRI datasets (BraTS 2020). Up to 9 point prompts were placed per slice. Tumor core (enhancing tumor + necrotic core) was segmented on contrast-enhanced T1w sequences. Out of the 3 masks predicted by SA, accuracy was evaluated for the mask with the highest calculated IoU (oracle mask) and with highest model predicted IoU (suggested mask). In addition to assessing SA on whole MRI slices, SA was also evaluated on images cropped to the tumor (max. 3D extent + 2 cm). Results: Mean best IoU (mbIoU) using oracle mask on full MRI slices was 0.762 (IQR 0.713-0.917). Best 2D mask was achieved after a mean of 6.6 point prompts (IQR 5-9). Segmentation accuracy was significantly better for high- compared to low-grade glioma cases (mbIoU 0.789 vs. 0.668). Accuracy was worse using MRI slices cropped to the tumor (mbIoU 0.759) and was much worse using suggested mask (full slices 0.572). For all experiments, accuracy was low on peripheral slices with few tumor voxels (mbIoU,<300: 0.537 vs.>=300: 0.841). Stacking best oracle segmentations from full axial MRI slices, mean 3D DSC for tumor core was 0.872, which was improved to 0.919 by combining axial, sagittal and coronal masks. Conclusions: The Segment Anything foundation model, while trained on photos, can achieve high zero-shot accuracy for glioma brain tumor segmentation on MRI slices. The results suggest that Segment Anything can accelerate and facilitate RT treatment planning, when properly integrated in a clinical application."}
