{"abstract":"We present TigerGraph, a graph database system built from the ground up to support massively parallel computation of queries and analytics. \nTigerGraph's high-level query language, GSQL, is designed for compatibility with SQL, while simultaneously allowing NoSQL programmers to continue thinking in Bulk-Synchronous Processing (BSP) terms and reap the benefits of high-level specification. \nGSQL is sufficiently high-level to allow declarative SQL-style programming, yet sufficiently expressive to concisely specify the sophisticated iterative algorithms required by modern graph analytics and traditionally coded in general-purpose programming languages like C++ and Java. \nWe report very strong scale-up and scale-out performance over a benchmark we published on GitHub for full reproducibility."}
