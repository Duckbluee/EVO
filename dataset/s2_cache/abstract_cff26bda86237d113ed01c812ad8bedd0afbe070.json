{"abstract":"The digitization of healthcare has facilitated the sharing and re-using of medical data but has also raised concerns about confidentiality and privacy. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) mandates removing re-identifying information before the dissemination of medical records. Thus, effective and efficient solutions for de-identifying medical data, especially those in free-text forms, are highly needed. While various computer-assisted de-identification methods, including both rule-based and learning-based, have been developed and used in prior practice, such solutions still lack generalizability or need to be fine-tuned according to different scenarios, significantly imposing restrictions in wider use. The advancement of large language models (LLM), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have shown great potential in processing text data in the medical domain with zero-shot in-context learning, especially in the task of privacy protection, as these models can identify confidential information by their powerful named entity recognition (NER) capability. In this work, we developed a novel GPT4-enabled de-identification framework (``DeID-GPT\") to automatically identify and remove the identifying information. Compared to existing commonly used medical text data de-identification methods, our developed DeID-GPT showed the highest accuracy and remarkable reliability in masking private information from the unstructured medical text while preserving the original structure and meaning of the text. This study is one of the earliest to utilize ChatGPT and GPT-4 for medical text data processing and de-identification, which provides insights for further research and solution development on the use of LLMs such as ChatGPT/GPT-4 in healthcare.
