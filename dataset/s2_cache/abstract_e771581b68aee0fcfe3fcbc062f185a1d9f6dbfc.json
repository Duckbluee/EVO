{"abstract":"We propose a universal adversarial attack on multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that leverages a single optimized image to override alignment safeguards across diverse queries and even multiple models. By backpropagating through the vision encoder and language head, we craft a synthetic image that forces the model to respond with a targeted phrase (e.g.,\"Sure, here it is\") or otherwise unsafe content -- even for harmful prompts. In experiments on the SafeBench and MM-SafetyBench benchmarks, our method achieves higher attack success rates than existing baselines, including text-only universal prompts (e.g., up to 81% on certain models). We further demonstrate cross-model universality by training on several multimodal LLMs simultaneously. Additionally, a multi-answer variant of our approach produces more natural-sounding (yet still malicious) responses. These findings underscore critical vulnerabilities in current multimodal alignment and call for more robust adversarial defenses. We will release code and datasets under the Apache-2.0 license.
