{"abstract":"Contemporary quantum computers face many critical challenges that limit their usefulness for practical applications. A primary limiting factor is classical-to-quantum (C2Q) data encoding, which requires specific circuits for quantum state initialization. The required state initialization circuits are often complex and violate decoherence constraints, particularly for I/O intensive applications. Existing Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices are noise-sensitive and have low quantum bit (qubit) counts, thus limiting the applicability of C2Q circuits for encoding large and realistic datasets. This has made the study of complete and realistic circuits that include data encoding challenging and has also led to a heavy dependency on costly and resource-intensive simulations on classical platforms. In this work, we propose a cost-effective, classical-hardware-accelerated framework for realistic and complete emulation of quantum algorithms. The emulation framework incorporates components for the critical C2Q data encoding process, as well as architectures for quantum algorithms such as the quantum Haar transform (QHT). The framework is used to investigate optimizations for C2Q and QHT algorithms, and the corresponding optimized quantum circuits are presented. The framework is implemented on a High-Performance Reconfigurable Computer (HPRC) which emulates the proposed QHT circuits combined with proposed C2Q data encoding methods. For performance benchmarks, CPU-based emulations and simulations on a state-of-the-art quantum computing simulator are also carried out. Results show that the proposed hardware-accelerated emulation framework is more efficient in terms of speed and scalability compared to CPU-based emulation and simulation."}
