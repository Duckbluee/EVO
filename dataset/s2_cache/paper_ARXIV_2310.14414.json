By incorporating language data, driving systems can gain a better understanding of real-world environments, thereby enhancing driving safety and efficiency. In this work, we present a comprehensive and systematic survey of the advances in vision language models in this domain, encompassing perception and understanding, navigation and planning, decision-making and control, end-to-end autonomous driving, and data generation. We introduce the mainstream VLM tasks in AD and the commonly utilized metrics. Additionally, we review current studies and applications in various areas and summarize the existing language-enhanced autonomous driving datasets thoroughly. Lastly, we discuss the benefits and challenges of VLMs in AD and provide researchers with the current research gaps and future trends."}
