{"abstract":"Ethics or moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies in a systematic way, defends, and suggests concepts of right or wrong performance. The branches of philosophy are metaphysics/ontology, epistemology, teleology, ethics, aesthetics, and logic. The branches of ethics are meta-ethics, normative ethics and applied ethics. Robotics and Automation Ethics is the branch of applied ethics which investigates the social and ethical issues of robotics and automation in the broader sense which includes all kinds of automated systems through the use of computer, information, communication, and control science and technology, and develops ethical methods for resolving them via the exploitation of traditional and novel ethical theories (such as deontological, utilitarianism, value-based theory, case-based theory, etc.) In particular, Robot Ethics (Roboethics) covers the entire range of ethical issues related to robot design, operation, and use. Today the central aim of robotics research is to create robots that possess full autonomy, i.e., the capability of autonomous decision making. Here is exactly where the major robo ethics issues arise. Actually, present day robots are still not fully autonomous. They are partially autonomous. At the lowest end they possess low level (operational) autonomy (i.e., autonomous execution of programmed operations without any human intervention), and passing from medium level-autonomy (functional autonomy), they approach the level of full autonomy (at which there is not any human intervention in decision-making, planning/scheduling, functioning, and action performing). The same is true for the issues of ethics, where we have several levels of morality, namely:1"}
