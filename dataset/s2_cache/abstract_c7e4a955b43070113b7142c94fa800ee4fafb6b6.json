{"abstract":"Several algorithms in prior literature have been proposed, which guarantee the consensus of normally behaving agents in a network that may contain adversarially behaving agents. These algorithms guarantee that the consensus value lies within the convex hull of initial normal agents’ states, with the exact consensus value possibly being unknown. In leader-follower consensus problems, however, the objective is for normally behaving agents to track a reference state that may take on values outside of this convex hull. In this paper, we present methods for agents in time-varying graphs with discrete-time dynamics to resiliently track a reference state propagated by a set of leaders, despite a bounded subset of the leaders and followers behaving adversarially. Our results are demonstrated through simulations."}
