{"abstract":"For better user satisfaction and business effectiveness, more and more attention has been paid to the sequence-based recommendation system, which is used to infer the evolution of users’ dynamic preferences, and recent studies have noticed that the evolution of users’ preferences can be better understood from the implicit and explicit feedback sequences. However, most of the existing recommendation techniques do not consider the noise contained in implicit feedback, which will lead to the biased representation of user interest and a suboptimal recommendation performance. Meanwhile, the existing methods utilize item sequence for capturing the evolution of user interest. The performance of these methods is limited by the length of the sequence, and can not effectively model the long-term interest in a long period of time. Based on this observation, we propose a novel CTR model named denoising user-aware memory network (DUMN). Specifically, the framework: (i) proposes a feature purification module based on orthogonal mapping, which use the representation of explicit feedback to purify the representation of implicit feedback, and effectively denoise the implicit feedback; (ii) designs a user memory network to model the long-term interests in a fine-grained way by improving the memory network, which is ignored by the existing methods; and (iii) develops a preference-aware interactive representation component to fuse the long-term and short-term interests of users based on gating to understand the evolution of unbiased preferences of users. Extensive experiments on two real e-commerce user behavior datasets show that DUMN has a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines."}
