{"abstract":"1. In the EFTA States, openness to trade and access to international markets is the basis for economic growth and general welfare. At the same time, the EFTA States apply and actively promote high standards for sustainable development and inclusiveness not only domestically, but also in their respective foreign policies. In fact, free trade and economic growth can contribute to the achievement of their sustainability policies. This experience of the EFTA States is widely shared internationally and the importance of trade as a means to promote sustainable development has been explicitly recognized in relevant international bodies, most recently in the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development2 which states that “international trade is an engine for inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction and contributes to the promotion of sustainable development”."}
