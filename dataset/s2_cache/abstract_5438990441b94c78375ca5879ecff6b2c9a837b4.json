{"abstract":"In this technical note, we present a new class of event triggering mechanisms for event-triggered control systems. This class is characterized by the introduction of an internal dynamic variable, which motivates the proposed name of dynamic event triggering mechanism. The stability of the resulting closed-loop system is proved and the influence of design parameters on the decay rate of the Lyapunov function is discussed. For linear systems, we establish a lower bound on the inter-execution time as a function of the parameters. The influence of these parameters on a quadratic integral performance index is also studied. Some simulation results are provided for illustration of the theoretical claims."}
