{"abstract":"Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has been widely used in many fields. Meanwhile, blockchain is considered promising to address the issues of the IIoT. However, the current blockchains have a limited throughput. In this article, we devise an efficient and secure blockchain protocol compacted directed acyclic graph (CoDAG) based on a compacted directed acyclic graph, where blocks are organized in levels and width. New-generated blocks in the CoDAG will be placed appropriately and point to those in the previous level, making it a well-connected channel. Transactions in the network will be confirmed in a deterministic period, and the CoDAG keeps a simple data structure at the same time. We also illustrate the attack strategies by adversary, and it is proved that our protocols are resistant to these attacks. Furthermore, we design a CoDAG-based IIoT architecture to improve the efficiency of the IIoT system. Experimental results show that the CoDAG achieves 164<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\times$</tex-math></inline-formula> Bitcoin's throughput and 77<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\times$</tex-math></inline-formula> Ethererum's throughput."}
