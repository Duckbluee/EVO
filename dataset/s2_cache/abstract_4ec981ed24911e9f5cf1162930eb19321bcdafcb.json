{"abstract":"Recent years have witnessed a surge in the popularity of Machine Learning (ML), applied across diverse domains. However, progress is impeded by the scarcity of training data due to expensive acquisition and privacy legislation. Synthetic data emerges as a solution, but the abundance of released models and limited overview literature pose challenges for decision-making. This work surveys 417 Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) models over the last decade, providing a comprehensive overview of model types, functionality, and improvements. Common attributes are identified, leading to a classification and trend analysis. The findings reveal increased model performance and complexity, with neural network-based approaches prevailing, except for privacy-preserving data generation. Computer vision dominates, with GANs as primary generative models, while diffusion models, transformers, and RNNs compete. Implications from our performance evaluation highlight the scarcity of common metrics and datasets, making comparisons challenging. Additionally, the neglect of training and computational costs in literature necessitates attention in future research. This work serves as a guide for SDG model selection and identifies crucial areas for future exploration."}
