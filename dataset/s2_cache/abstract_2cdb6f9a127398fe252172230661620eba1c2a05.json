{"abstract":"As a promising solution for model compression, knowledge distillation (KD) has been applied in recommender systems (RS) to reduce inference latency. Traditional solutions first train a full teacher model from the training data, and then transfer its knowledge (\\iesoft labels ) to supervise the learning of a compact student model. However, we find such a standard distillation paradigm would incur serious bias issue --- popular items are more heavily recommended after the distillation. This effect prevents the student model from making accurate and fair recommendations, decreasing the effectiveness of RS. In this work, we identify the origin of the bias in KD --- it roots in the biased soft labels from the teacher, and is further propagated and intensified during the distillation. To rectify this, we propose a new KD method with a stratified distillation strategy. It first partitions items into multiple groups according to their popularity, and then extracts the ranking knowledge within each group to supervise the learning of the student. Our method is simple and teacher-agnostic --- it works on distillation stage without affecting the training of the teacher model. We conduct extensive theoretical and empirical studies to validate the effectiveness of our proposal. We release our code at: https://github.com/chengang95/UnKD."}
