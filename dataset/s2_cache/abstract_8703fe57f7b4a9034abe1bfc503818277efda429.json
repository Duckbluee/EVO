{"abstract":"Inspired by the well-known Papez circuit theory and neuroscience knowledge of reinforcement learning, a double dueling deep $Q$ network (DQN) is built incorporating the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of the frontal lobe as prior information, which is named frontal lobe double dueling DQN (FLD3QN). The framework of FLD3QN is constructed in accord with the brain emotion mechanism which takes the frontal lobe and the thalamus as the core, in which the part of the Papez circuit is simulated by the bifrontal lobe residual convolution neural network (BiFRCNN). Moreover, a step penalty factor is designed to constrain the number of mistakes of the agent. The ablation studies results on the public EEG emotion dataset DEAP verified the important roles of the frontal lobe and the Papez circuit in modeling the procedure of learning rewards during the perception of emotions, with a great increase in the average accuracies by 25.24% and 23.31% in valence and arousal dimensions."}
