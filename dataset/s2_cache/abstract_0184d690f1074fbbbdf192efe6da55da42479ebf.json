{"abstract":"Catastrophic forgetting is one of the most critical challenges in Continual Learning (CL). Recent approaches tackle this problem by projecting the gradient update orthogonal to the gradient subspace of existing tasks. While the results are remarkable, those approaches ignore the fact that these calculated gradients are not guaranteed to be orthogonal to the gradient subspace of each class due to the class deviation in tasks, e.g., distinguishing \"Man\" from \"Sea\" v.s. differentiating \"Boy\" from \"Girl\". Therefore, this strategy may still cause catastrophic forgetting for some classes. In this paper, we propose Class Gradient Projection (CGP), which calculates the gradient subspace from individual classes rather than tasks. Gradient update orthogonal to the gradient subspace of existing classes can be effectively utilized to minimize interference from other classes. To improve the generalization and efficiency, we further design a Base Refining (BR) algorithm to combine similar classes and refine class bases dynamically. Moreover, we leverage a contrastive learning method to improve the model's ability to handle unseen tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. It improves the previous methods by 2.0% on the CIFAR-100 dataset.
