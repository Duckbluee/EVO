{"abstract":"\n Interpretation of non-coding genome remains an unsolved challenge in human genetics due to impracticality of exhaustively annotate biochemically active elements in all conditions. Deep learning based computational approaches emerge recently to help interpretating non-coding regions. Here we present LOGO (Language of Genome), a self-attention based contextualized pre-trained language model that applies self-supervision techniques to learn bidirectional representations of unlabeled human reference genome and extend to a series of downstream tasks via fine-tuning. We also explore a novel knowledge embedded version of LOGO to incorporate prior human annotations. Experiments show that LOGO achieves 15% absolute improvement for promoter identification and up to 4.5% absolute improvement for enhancer-promoter interaction prediction. LOGO exhibits state-of-the-art predictive power on chromatin features with only 3% parameterization against fully supervised convolutional neural network, DeepSEA. Fine-tuned LOGO also shows outstanding performance in prioritizing non-coding variants associated with human diseases. In addition, we apply LOGO to interpret type 2 diabetes (T2D) GWAS signals and infer underlying regulatory mechanisms. We make a conceptual analogy between natural language and human genome and demonstrate LOGO is an accurate, fast, scalable, and robust framework with powerful adaptability to various tasks without substantial task-specific architecture modifications."}
