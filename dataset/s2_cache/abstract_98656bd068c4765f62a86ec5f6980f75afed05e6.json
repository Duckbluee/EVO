{"abstract":"Current unsupervised domain adaptation methods can address many types of distribution shift, but they assume data from the source domain is freely available. As the use of pre-trained models becomes more prevalent, it is reasonable to assume that source data is unavailable. We propose an unsupervised method for adapting a source classifier to a target domain that varies from the source domain along natural axes, such as brightness and contrast. Our method only requires access to unlabeled target instances and the source classifier. We validate our method in scenarios where the distribution shift involves brightness, contrast, and rotation and show that it outperforms fine-tuning baselines in scenarios with limited labeled data."}
