{"abstract":"Due to its capacity to gather vast, high-level data about human activity from wearable or stationary sensors, human activity recognition substantially impacts people’s day-to-day lives. Multiple people and things may be seen acting in the video, dispersed throughout the frame in various places. Because of this, modeling the interactions between many entities in spatial dimensions is necessary for visual reasoning in the action recognition task. The main aim of this paper is to evaluate and map the current scenario of human actions in red, green, and blue videos, based on deep learning models. A residual network (ResNet) and a vision transformer architecture (ViT) with a semi-supervised learning approach are evaluated. The DINO (self-DIstillation with NO labels) is used to enhance the potential of the ResNet and ViT. The evaluated benchmark is the human motion database (HMDB51), which tries to better capture the richness and complexity of human actions. The obtained results for video classification with the proposed ViT are promising based on performance metrics and results from the recent literature. The results obtained using a bi-dimensional ViT with long short-term memory demonstrated great performance in human action recognition when applied to the HMDB51 dataset. The mentioned architecture presented 96.7 ± 0.35% and 41.0 ± 0.27% in terms of accuracy (mean ± standard deviation values) in the train and test phases of the HMDB51 dataset, respectively."}
