{"abstract":"Academic integrity in both higher education and scientific writing has been challenged by developments in artificial intelligence. The limitations associated with algorithms have been largely overcome by the recently released ChatGPT; a chatbot powered by GPT-3.5 capable of producing accurate and human-like responses to questions in real-time. Despite the potential benefits, ChatGPT confronts significant limitations to its usefulness in nuclear medicine and radiology. Most notably, ChatGPT is prone to errors and fabrication of information which poses a risk to professionalism, ethics and integrity. These limitations simultaneously undermine the value of ChatGPT to the user by not producing outcomes at the expected standard. Nonetheless, there are a number of exciting applications of ChatGPT in nuclear medicine across education, clinical and research sectors. Assimilation of ChatGPT into practice requires redefining of norms, and re-engineering of information expectations."}
