{"abstract":"Differential privacy (DP) enables model training with a guaranteed bound on privacy leakage, therefore is widely adopted in federated learning (FL) to protect the model update. However, each DP-enhanced FL job accumulates privacy leakage, which necessitates a unified platform to enforce a global privacy budget for each dataset owned by users. In this work, we present a novel DP-enhanced FL platform that treats privacy as a resource and schedules multiple FL jobs across sensitive data. It first introduces a novel notion of device-time blocks for distributed data streams. Such data abstraction enables fine-grained privacy consumption composition across multiple FL jobs. Regarding the non-replenishable nature of the privacy resource (that differs it from traditional hardware resources like CPU and memory), it further employs an allocation-then-recycle scheduling algorithm. Its key idea is to first allocate an estimated upper-bound privacy budget for each arrived FL job, and then progressively recycle the unused budget as training goes on to serve further FL jobs. Extensive experiments show that our platform is able to deliver up to 2.1× as many completed jobs while reducing the violation rate by up to 55.2% under limited privacy budget constraint."}
