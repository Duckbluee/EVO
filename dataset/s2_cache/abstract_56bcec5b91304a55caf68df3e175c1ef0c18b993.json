{"abstract":"It is undeniable that the adoption of blockchain- and artificial intelligence (AI)-based paradigms is proceeding at lightning speed. Both paradigms provide something new to the market, but the degree of novelty and complexity of each is different. In the age of digital money, blockchains may automate installments to allow for the safe, decentralized exchange of personal data, information, and logs. AI and blockchains are two of the most talked about technologies right now. Using a decentralized, secure, and trustworthy system, blockchain technology can automate bitcoin payments and provide users access to a shared ledger of records, transactions, and data. Through the use of smart contracts, a blockchain may also regulate user interactions without the need for a central authority. As an alternative, AI provides robots with the ability to reason and make decisions and human-level intellect. This revelation led to a thorough assessment of the AI and blockchain combo created between 2012 and 2022. This critical review contains 121 articles from the recent decade that investigate the present situation and rationale of the AI and blockchain combination. The integration’s practical application is the emphasis of this overview’s meatiest portion. In addition, the gaps and problems of this combination in the linked literature have been studied, with a focus on the constraints."}
