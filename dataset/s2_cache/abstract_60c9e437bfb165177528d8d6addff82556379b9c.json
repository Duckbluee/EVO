{"abstract":"Interactive fictions—also called text-based games—are games in which a player interacts with a virtual world purely through textual natural language. In this work, we focus on procedurally generating interactive fiction worlds. Generating these worlds requires (a) referencing everyday and thematic commonsense priors in addition to (b) being semantically consistent, (c) interesting, (d) coherent throughout, all while (e) producing fluent natural language descriptions of places, people, and things. Using existing story plots from books as inspiration, we present a method that first extracts a partial knowledge graph encoding basic information regarding world structure such as locations and objects. This knowledge graph is then automatically completed utilizing thematic knowledge and used to guide a neural language generation model that fleshes out the rest of the world. We evaluate generated worlds with human-participant studies, comparing our technique against rule-based and human-made baselines"}
