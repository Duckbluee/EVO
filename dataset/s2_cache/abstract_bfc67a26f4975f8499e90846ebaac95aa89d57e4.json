{"abstract":"Top-k recommendation is a fundamental task in recommendation systems that is generally learned by comparing positive and negative pairs. The contrastive loss (CL) is the key in contrastive learning that has recently received more attention, and we find that it is well suited for top-k recommendations. However, CL is problematic because it treats the importance of the positive and negative samples the same. On the one hand, CL faces the imbalance problem of one positive sample and many negative samples. On the other hand, there are so few positive items in sparser datasets that their importance should be emphasized. Moreover, the other important issue is that the sparse positive items are still not sufficiently utilized in recommendations. Consequently, we propose a new data augmentation method by using multiple positive items (or samples) simultaneously with the CL loss function. Therefore, we propose a multisample-based contrastive loss (MSCL) function that solves the two problems by balancing the importance of positive and negative samples and data augmentation. Based on the graph convolution network (GCN) method, experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MSCL. The proposed MSCL is simple and can be applied in many methods.
