{"abstract":"The chapter moves the analysis to the realm of distributive justice. It explores whether inherent to the climate change and people movement nexus are issues of unequal distribution, for example, of benefits and burdens. The chapter outlines distributional issues and then suggests whether, from a distributive justice standpoint, equity could be achieved through redistribution of costs which may accrue for those under pressure to move. The chapter sketches the extent to which international law is underpinned by distributive justice notions. It then, more explicitly, turns to international environmental law, and in particular the international climate change adaptation and finance architectures, to analyse whether, in combination, they support remedying distributional issues in relation to people movement in the climate change context."}
