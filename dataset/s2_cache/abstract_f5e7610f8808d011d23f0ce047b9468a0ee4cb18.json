{"abstract":"Cross-network node classification aims to train a classifier for an unlabeled target network using a source network with rich labels. In applications, the degree of nodes mostly conforms to the long-tail distribution, i.e., most nodes in the network are tail nodes with sparse neighborhoods. The established methods focus on either the discrepancy cross network or the long tail in a single network. As for the cross-network node classification under long tail, the coexistence of sparsity of tail nodes and the discrepancy cross-network challenges existing methods for long tail or methods for the cross-network node classification. To this end, a multicomponent similarity graphs for cross-network node classification (MS-CNC) is proposed in this article. Specifically, in order to address the sparsity of the tail nodes, multiple component similarity graphs, including attribute and structure similarity graphs, are constructed for each network to enrich the neighborhoods of the tail nodes and alleviate the long-tail phenomenon. Then, multiple representations are learned from the multiple similarity graphs separately. Based on the multicomponent representations, a two-level adversarial model is designed to address the distribution difference across networks. One level is used to learn the invariant representations cross network in view of structure and attribute components separately, and the other level is used to learn the invariant representations in view of the fused structure and attribute graphs. Extensive experimental results show that the MS-CNC outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."}
