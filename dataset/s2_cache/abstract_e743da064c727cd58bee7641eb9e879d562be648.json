{"abstract":"In the contemporary landscape of computing education, the ubiquity of Generative Artificial Intelligence has significantly disrupted traditional assessment methods, rendering them obsolete and prompting educators to seek innovative alternatives. This research paper explores the challenges posed by Generative AI in the assessment domain and the persistent attempts to circumvent its impact. Despite various efforts to devise workarounds, the academic community is yet to find a comprehensive solution. Amidst this struggle, ungrading emerges as a potential yet under-appreciated solution to the assessment dilemma. Ungrading, a pedagogical approach that involves moving away from traditional grading systems, has faced resistance due to its perceived complexity and the reluctance of educators to depart from conventional assessment practices. However, as the inadequacies of current assessment methods become increasingly evident in the face of Generative AI, the time is ripe to reconsider and embrace ungrading."}
