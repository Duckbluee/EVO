{"abstract":"The emergence of ChatGPT in the field of education has opened up new opportunities for language learning, but it has also brought about significant ethical considerations that must be carefully considered and addressed to ensure that this technology is used responsibly. With the field of artificial intelligence (AI) advancing at an unprecedented rate, it is imperative for educators and administrators to remain vigilant in monitoring the ethical implications of integrating ChatGPT into language education and beyond. This paper will explore several ethical dimensions concerning the use of ChatGPT, a sophisticated language model developed by OpenAI, in language education. It will discuss privacy, bias, reliability, accessibility, authenticity, and academic integrity as significant ethical implications to consider while integrating ChatGPT into the language classroom. By gaining an initial understanding of the ethical implications involved in utilizing ChatGPT in language education, students, teachers, and administrators will be able to make informed decisions about the appropriate use of the technology, ensuring that it is employed in an ethical and responsible manner."}
