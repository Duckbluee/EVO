{"abstract":"While large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive NLP capabilities, existing IR applications mainly focus on prompting LLMs to generate query expansions or generating permutations for listwise reranking. In this study, we leverage LLMs directly to serve as components in the widely used multi-stage text ranking pipeline. Specifically, we fine-tune the open-source LLaMA-2 model as a dense retriever (repLLaMA) and a pointwise reranker (rankLLaMA). This is performed for both passage and document retrieval tasks using the MS MARCO training data. Our study shows that finetuned LLM retrieval models outperform smaller models. They are more effective and exhibit greater generalizability, requiring only a straightforward training strategy. Moreover, our pipeline allows for the fine-tuning of LLMs at each stage of a multi-stage retrieval pipeline. This demonstrates the strong potential for optimizing LLMs to enhance a variety of retrieval tasks. Furthermore, as LLMs are naturally pre-trained with longer contexts, they can directly represent longer documents. This eliminates the need for heuristic segmenting and pooling strategies to rank long documents. On the MS MARCO and BEIR datasets, our repLLaMA-rankLLaMA pipeline demonstrates a high level of effectiveness."}
