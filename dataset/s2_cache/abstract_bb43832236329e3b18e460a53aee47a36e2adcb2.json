{"abstract":"In reality, learning from multi-view multi-label data inevitably confronts three challenges: missing labels, incomplete views, and non-aligned views. Existing methods mainly concern the first two and commonly need multiple assumptions to attack them, making even state-of-the-arts involve at least two explicit hyper-parameters such that model selection is quite difficult. More toughly, they will fail in handling the third challenge, let alone addressing the three jointly. In this paper, we aim at meeting these under the least assumption by building a concise yet effective model with just one hyper-parameter. To ease insufficiency of available labels, we exploit not only the consensus of multiple views but also the global and local structures hidden among multiple labels. Specifically, we introduce an indicator matrix to tackle the first two challenges in a regression form while aligning the same individual labels and all labels of different views in a common label space to battle the third challenge. In aligning, we characterize the global and local structures of multiple labels to be high-rank and low-rank, respectively. Subsequently, an efficient algorithm with linear time complexity in the number of samples is established. Finally, even without view-alignment, our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-arts with view-alignment on five real datasets."}
