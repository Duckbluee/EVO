{"abstract":"A model extraction attack aims to clone a machine learning target model deployed in the cloud solely by querying the target in a black-box manner. Once a clone is obtained it is possible to launch further attacks with the aid of the local model. In this survey, we analyze existing approaches and present a taxonomic overview of this field based on several important aspects that affect attack efficiency and performance. We present both early works and recently explored directions. We conclude with an analysis of future directions based on recent developments in machine learning methodology."}
