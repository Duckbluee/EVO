{"abstract":"Economics is the science of decision making. The rigorous and general approach that characterizes economics lends itself to a remarkably wide ﬁeld of practical application. Economists are noted for major contributions in a number of ﬁelds including government policy, taxation, law, economy, international trade and ﬁnance, international and U.S. development, marketing, environmental studies, medical policy, portfolio management and banking. The broad and rigorous training of economics majors accounts for their signiﬁcant demand in virtually every industry and government agency. Economics provides excellent preparation for advanced graduate study as well. Recent studies indicate that economics is a preferred degree for prestigious MBA programs and law schools."}
