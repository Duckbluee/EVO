{"abstract":"Scene graphs are nodes and edges consisting of objects and object-object relationships, respectively. Scene graph generation (SGG) aims to identify the objects and their relationships. We propose a bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) transformer network (BGT-Net) for the scene graph generation for images. This model implements novel object-object communication to enhance the object information using a BiGRU layer. Thus, the information of all objects in the image is available for the other objects, which can be leveraged later in the object prediction step. This object information is used in a transformer encoder to predict the object class as well as to create object-specific edge information via the use of another transformer encoder. To handle the dataset bias induced by the long-tailed relationship distribution, softening with a log-softmax function and adding a bias adaptation term to regulate the bias for every relation prediction individually showed to be an effective approach. We conducted an elaborate study on experiments and ablations using open-source datasets, i.e., Visual Genome, Open-Images, and Visual Relationship Detection datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model over state of the art."}
