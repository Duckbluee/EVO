{"abstract":"Key Points Question Can current conversational large language models (LLMs) be used as a tool for personalized decision-making in precision oncology? Findings In this diagnostic study, treatment option identification from 4 LLMs for 10 fictional patients deviated substantially from expert recommendations. Nevertheless, LLMs correctly identified several important treatment strategies and partly provided reasonable suggestions that were not easily found by experts. Meaning These results suggest that LLMs are not yet applicable as a routine tool for aiding personalized clinical decision-making in oncology, but do improve upon existing LLM-based methods."}
