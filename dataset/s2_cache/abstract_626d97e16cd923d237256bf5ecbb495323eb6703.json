{"abstract":"The activity of composition is little discussed in philosophy, understandably due to its disunity across musical cultures. In the context of the individually composed concert music that has preoccupied the discipline, composing and the composer are often invoked figuratively as objects of a kind of engagement expected of the listener. This figure has survived a reversal of direction in a prominent line of anti-modern musical critique, in which composers can be faulted for not proceeding in ways that match those to which listeners supposedly are bound. In a music-analytical example drawn from the finale of Ruth Crawford Seeger’s String Quartet, alternatives are offered to these views. Explicit compositional procedures, realizing Crawford’s radical conception of dissonance, are regarded as influential upon, not definitive of, audible traits of what they produce; and the utility of these procedures is seen as including idle, indirect, and even counter-productive elements. Awareness of compositional process, and of the conceptions in which it is embedded, may substantially affect audition and appreciation."}
