{"abstract":"Natural language computer applications are becoming increasingly sophisticated and, with the recent release of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3, they could be deployed in healthcare-related contexts that have historically comprised human-to-human interaction. However, for GPT-3 and similar applications to be considered for use in health-related contexts, possibilities and pitfalls need thoughtful exploration. In this article, we briefly introduce some opportunities and cautions that would accompany advanced Natural Language Processing applications deployed in eHealth."}
