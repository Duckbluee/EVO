{"abstract":"Driver fatigue evaluation is of great importance for traffic safety and many intricate factors would exacerbate the difficulty. In this paper, based on the spatial–temporal structure of multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, we develop a novel EEG-based spatial–temporal convolutional neural network (ESTCNN) to detect driver fatigue. First, we introduce the core block to extract temporal dependencies from EEG signals. Then, we employ dense layers to fuse spatial features and realize classification. The developed network could automatically learn valid features from EEG signals, which outperforms the classical two-step machine learning algorithms. Importantly, we carry out fatigue driving experiments to collect EEG signals from eight subjects being alert and fatigue states. Using 2800 samples under within-subject splitting, we compare the effectiveness of ESTCNN with eight competitive methods. The results indicate that ESTCNN fulfills a better classification accuracy of 97.37% than these compared methods. Furthermore, the spatial–temporal structure of this framework advantages in computational efficiency and reference time, which allows further implementations in the brain–computer interface online systems."}
