{"abstract":"This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning powered approach for tabletop object sorting. Once perceived the environment, the system creates a semantic representation of the scene, describing the pose and category of each recognized object. This image is then provided as input to the trained Deep Neural Network in charge of choosing the correct action to be performed to successfully achieve the sorting task. Obtained results prove the capability of the proposed system, including its intrinsic robustness to failures and unpredictable interactions with humans or other environmental agents. Moreover, the use of semantic images makes the Deep Neural Network independent from the type of objects to be sorted and from their final placement location. Finally, the system is scalable, being capable of sorting as many known objects as recognized by the perception system. Currently, the system can sort objects belonging to two predefined categories while treating all the others as obstacles. Future works will extend the system making it capable of sorting potentially any type and number of object categories."}
