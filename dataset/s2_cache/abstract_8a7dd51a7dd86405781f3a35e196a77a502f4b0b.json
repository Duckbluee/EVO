{"abstract":"Graph convolutional network (GCN) has been shown effective in many applications with graph structures. However, training a large-scale GCN is still challenging due to the high computation cost that grows with the size of the graph. In this paper, we propose CM-GCN, a distributed GCN framework using cohesive mini-batches to accelerate large-scale GCN training. The cohesive mini-batches group nodes that are tightly connected in the graph. As a result, CM-GCN can reduce the computation required to train a GCN. We propose a computation cost function to quantify the computation required for mini-batches. By exploring the submodular property of the computation cost function, we develop an efficient algorithm to partition nodes into tightly coupled mini-batches. Based on the computation cost function, we evenly distribute the workloads of mini-batches to workers. We design asynchronous computations between GCN layers to further eliminating the waiting among workers. We implement a CM-GCN framework and evaluate its performance with graphs that contain millions of nodes. Our evaluation shows that CM-GCN can achieve up to 3X speedup without compromising the training accuracy."}
