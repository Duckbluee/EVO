{"abstract":"As autonomous vehicle technology advances, high‐definition (HD) maps have become essential for ensuring safety and navigation accuracy. However, creating HD maps with accurate annotations demands substantial human effort, leading to a time‐consuming and costly process. Although artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) algorithms have been developed for prelabeling HD maps, a significant gap remains in accuracy and robustness between AI‐based methods and traditional manual pipelines. Additionally, building large‐scale annotated datasets and advanced machine learning algorithms for AI‐based HD map labeling systems can be resource‐intensive. In this paper, we present and summarize the Tencent HD Map AI (THMA) system, an innovative end‐to‐end, AI‐based, active learning HD map labeling system designed to produce HD map labels for hundreds of thousands of kilometers while employing active learning to enhance product iteration. Utilizing a combination of supervised, self‐supervised, and weakly supervised learning, THMA is trained directly on massive HD map datasets to achieve the high accuracy and efficiency required by downstream users. Deployed by the Tencent Map team, THMA serves over 1000 labeling workers and generates more than 30,000 km of HD map data per day at its peak. With over 90% of Tencent Map's HD map data labeled automatically by THMA, the system accelerates traditional HD map labeling processes by more than tenfold, significantly reducing manual annotation burdens and paving the way for more efficient HD map production."}
