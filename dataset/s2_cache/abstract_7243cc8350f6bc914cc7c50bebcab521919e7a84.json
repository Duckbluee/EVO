{"abstract":"We present an approach which takes advantage of both structure and semantics for unsupervised monocular learning of depth and ego-motion. More specifically we model the motions of individual objects and learn their 3D motion vector jointly with depth and ego-motion. We obtain more accurate results, especially for challenging dynamic scenes not addressed by previous approaches. This is an extended version of Casser et al.
