{"abstract":"We present a collaborative mixed-initiative system for building levels for the puzzle game \"Baba is You\". Unlike previous mixed-initiative systems, Baba is Y’all is designed for collaborative asynchronous creation by multiple users over the internet. The system includes several AI-assisted features to help designers, including a level evolver and an automated player for playtesting. The level archives catalogues levels according to which mechanics are implemented and not implemented, allowing the system to ask users to design levels with specific combinations of mechanics. We describe the operation of the system and the results of small-scale informal user test, and discuss future development paths for this system as well as for collaborative mixed-initiative systems in general."}
