{"abstract":"Today, the presence of harmful and inappropriate content on the web still remains one of the most primary concerns for web users. Web classification models in the early days are limited by the methods and data available. In our research we revisit the web classification problem with the application of new methods and techniques for text content analysis. Our recent studies have indicated the promising potential of combing topic analysis and sentiment analysis in web content classification. In this paper we further explore new ways and methods to improve and maximize classification performance, especially to enhance precision and reduce false positives, thorough examination and handling of the issues with class imbalance, and through incorporation of LDA topic models."}
