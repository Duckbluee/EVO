{"abstract":"Deep neural networks are popular for visual perception tasks such as image classification and object detection. Once trained and deployed in a real-time environment, these models struggle to identify novel inputs not initially represented in the training distribution. Further, they cannot be easily updated on new information or they will catastrophically forget previously learned knowledge. While there has been much interest in developing models capable of overcoming forgetting, most research has focused on incrementally learning from common image classification datasets broken up into large batches. Online streaming learning is a more realistic paradigm where a model must learn one sample at a time from temporally correlated data streams. Although there are a few datasets designed specifically for this protocol, most have limitations such as few classes or poor image quality. In this work, we introduce Stream-51, a new dataset for streaming classification consisting of tempo- rally correlated images from 51 distinct object categories and additional evaluation classes outside of the training distribution to test novelty recognition. We establish unique evaluation protocols, experimental metrics, and baselines for our dataset in the streaming paradigm1."}
