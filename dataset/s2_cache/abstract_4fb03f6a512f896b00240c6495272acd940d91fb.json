{"abstract":"As more robots are being deployed into human environments, a human-aware navigation planner needs to handle multiple contexts that occur in indoor and outdoor environments. In this paper, we propose a tunable human-aware robot navigation planner that can handle a variety of humanrobot contexts. We present the architecture of the planner and discuss the features and some implementation details. Then we present a detailed analysis of various simulated humanrobot contexts using the proposed planner along with some quantitative results. Finally, we show the results in a real-world scenario after deploying our system on a real robot."}
