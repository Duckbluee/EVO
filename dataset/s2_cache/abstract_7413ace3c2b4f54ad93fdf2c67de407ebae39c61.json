{"abstract":"In current deep learning paradigms, local training or the Standalone framework tends to result in overfitting and thus poor generalizability. This problem can be addressed by Distributed or Federated Learning (FL) that leverages a parameter server to aggregate model updates from individual participants. However, most existing Distributed or FL frameworks have overlooked an important aspect of participation: collaborative fairness. In particular, all participants can receive the same or similar models, regardless of their contributions. To address this issue, we investigate the collaborative fairness in FL, and propose a novel Collaborative Fair Federated Learning (CFFL) framework which utilizes reputation to enforce participants to converge to different models, thus achieving fairness without compromising the predictive performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFFL achieves high fairness, delivers comparable accuracy to the Distributed framework, and outperforms the Standalone framework."}
