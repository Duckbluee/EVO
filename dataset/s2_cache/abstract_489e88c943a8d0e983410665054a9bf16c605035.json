{"abstract":"Authentication is an important issue in wireless communications because the open nature of the wireless medium provides more security vulnerabilities. Recently, Physical-Layer Authentication (PLA) attracts many research interests because it provides information-theory security and low complexity. Although many researchers focus on the PLA and exploit its potential in enhancing wireless security, the literature is surprisingly sparse with no comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art PLA and the key fundamentals involved. Thus, this article provides a detailed survey of features and techniques that can be used in the PLA. We categorize the existing PLA schemes into two categories: passive and active schemes. In the passive schemes, a receiver authenticates the transmitter based on the physical-layer features of the received signals. We further divide the passive schemes into two sub-categories: device-based features and channel-based features. In the active schemes, a transmitter generates a tag based on a secret key and embeds it into a source message. Then, a receiver authenticates the transmitter based on the tag whether it exists in the received signal. We further divide active schemes into two sub-categories: non-covert schemes and covert schemes. Moreover, we also provide some future research directions."}
