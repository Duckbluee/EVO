{"abstract":"The explosive growth of Large-Language Models (LLMs), particularly Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models, has revolutionised fields ranging from natural language processing to creative writing. Yet, their reliance on vast, often unverified data sources introduces a critical vulnerability: unreliability and security concerns. Traditional GPT models, while impressive in their capabilities, struggle with limited factual accuracy and susceptibility to manipulation by biased or malicious data. This poses a significant risk in professional and personal environments where sensitive or mission-critical data is paramount. This work tackles this challenge head-on by proposing a novel approach to enhance GPT security and reliability: leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). Unlike traditional cryptographic methods that require sensitive data exchange, ZKPs allow one party to convincingly prove the truth of a statement, without revealing the underlying information. In the context of GPTs, ZKPs can validate the legitimacy and quality of data sources used in GPT computations, combating data manipulation and misinformation. This ensures trustworthy outputs, even when incorporating third-party data (TPD). ZKPs can securely verify user identities and access privileges, preventing unauthorised access to sensitive data and functionality. This protects critical information and promotes responsible LLM usage. ZKPs can identify and filter out manipulative prompts designed to elicit harmful or biased responses from GPTs. This safeguards against malicious actors and promotes ethical LLM development. ZKPs facilitate training specialised GPT models on targeted datasets, resulting in deeper understanding and more accurate outputs within specific domains. This allows the creation of ‘expert-GPT’ applications in specialised fields like healthcare, finance, and legal services. The integration of ZKPs into GPT models represents a crucial step towards overcoming trust and security barriers. Our research demonstrates the viability and efficacy of this approach, with our ZKP-based authentication system achieving promising results in data verification, user control, and malicious prompt detection. These findings lay the groundwork for a future where GPTs, empowered by ZKPs, operate with unwavering integrity, fostering trust and accelerating ethical AI development across diverse domains."}
