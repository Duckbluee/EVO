{"abstract":"Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and its variants are popular few-shot classification methods. They train an initializer across a variety of sampled learning tasks (also known as episodes) such that the initialized model can adapt quickly to new ones. However, current MAML-based algorithms have limitations in forming generalizable decision boundaries. In this paper, we propose an approach called MetaMix, which generates virtual feature-target pairs within each episode to regularize the backbone models. MetaMix can be integrated with any of the MAML-based algorithms and learn the decision boundaries generalizing better to new tasks. Experiments on the mini-ImageNet, CUB, and FC100 datasets show that MetaMix improves the performance of MAML-based algorithms and achieves state-of-the-art result when integrated with Meta-Transfer Learning."}
