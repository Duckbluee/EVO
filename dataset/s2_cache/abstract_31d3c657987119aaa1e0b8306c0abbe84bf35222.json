{"abstract":"The computing demand for massive applications has led to the ubiquitous deployment of computing power. This trend results in the urgent need for higher-level computing resource scheduling services. The Computing and Network Convergence (CNC), a new type of infrastructure, has become a hot topic. To realize the visions of CNC, such as computing-network integration, ubiquitous collaboration, latency-free, and ready-to-use, an intelligent scheduling strategy for CNC should integrate and collaborate with the network. However, the Computing and Network Convergence is built on the cloud, edge, and endless terminals, making the scheduling problem more difficult due to its wide-area requests, available flexibility arrangements, interconnections, and resource adaptations. In view of this, in this survey, we comprehensively review the literature on scheduling in various scenarios. We cover the scheduling problem of Computing and Network Convergence from heterogeneous resources, multiple-objective optimization, and diverse tasks. Possible explanations and implications are discussed. Finally, we point out important challenges for future work."}
