{"abstract":"The radio spectrum (3kHz – 300GHz) has become saturated and proven to be insufficient to address the proliferation of new wireless applications. Cognitive Radio Technology which is an opportunistic network and is equipped with fully programmable wireless devices that empowers the network by OODA cycle and then make intelligent decisions by adapting their MAC and physical layer characteristics such as waveform, has appeared to be the only solution for current low spectrum availability and under utilization problem. In this paper a novel Dynamic De-Centralized Hybrid “DDH-MAC” protocol for Cognitive Radio Networks has been presented which lies between Global Common Control Channel (GCCC) and non-GCCC categories of cognitive radio MAC protocols. DDH-MAC is equipped with the best features of GCCC MAC protocols but also overcomes the saturation and security issues in GCCC. To the best of authors' knowledge, DDH-MAC is the first protocol which is hybrid between GCCC and non-GCCC family of protocols. DDH-MAC provides multiple levels of security and partially use GCCC to transmit beacon which sets and announces local control channel for exchange of free channel list (FCL) sensed by the co-operatively communicating cognitive radio nodes, subsequently providing secure transactions among participating nodes over the decided local control channel. This paper describes the framework of the DDH-MAC protocol in addition to its pseudo code for implementation; it is shown that the pre-transmission time for DDH-MAC is on average 20% better while compared to other cognitive radio MAC protocols."}
