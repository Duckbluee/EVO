{"abstract":"Despite the remarkable progress facilitated by learning-based stereo-matching algorithms, the performance in the ill-conditioned regions, such as the occluded regions, remains a bottleneck. Due to the limited receptive field, existing CNN-based methods struggle to handle these ill-conditioned regions effectively. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel attention-based stereo-matching network called Global Occlusion-Aware Transformer (GOAT) to exploit long-range dependency and occlusion-awareness global context for disparity estimation. In the GOAT architecture, a parallel disparity and occlusion estimation module (PDO) is proposed to estimate the initial disparity map and the occlusion mask using a parallel attention mechanism. To further enhance the disparity estimates in the occluded regions, an occlusion-aware global aggregation module (OGA) is proposed. This module aims to refine the disparity in the occluded regions by leveraging restricted global correlation within the focus scope of the occluded areas. Extensive experiments were conducted on several public benchmark datasets including SceneFlow [15], KITTI 2015 [16], and Middlebury [19]. The results show that proposed GOAT demonstrates outstanding performance among all benchmarks, particularly in the occluded regions."}
