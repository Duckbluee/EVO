{"abstract":"Inspired by the success of contrastive learning, we systematically examine recommendation losses, including listwise (softmax), pairwise (BPR), and pointwise (MSE and CCL) losses. In this endeavor, we introduce InfoNCE+, an optimized generalization of InfoNCE with balance coefficients, and highlight its performance advantages, particularly when aligned with our new decoupled contrastive loss, MINE+. We also leverage debiased InfoNCE to debias pointwise recommendation loss (CCL) as Debiased CCL. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that linear models like iALS and EASE are inherently debiased. Empirical results demonstrates the effectiveness of MINE+ and Debiased-CCL."}
