{"abstract":"Recommendation dialogue systems aim to build social bonds with users and provide high-quality recommendations. This paper pushes forward towards a promising paradigm called target-driven recommendation dialogue systems, which is highly desired yet under-explored. We focus on how to naturally lead users to accept the designated targets gradually through conversations. To this end, we propose a Target-driven Conversation Planning (TCP) framework to plan a sequence of dialogue actions and topics, driving the system to transit between different conversation stages proactively. We then apply our TCP with planned content to guide dialogue generation. Experimental results show that our conversation planning significantly improves the performance of target-driven recommendation dialogue systems."}
