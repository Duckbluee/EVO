{"abstract":"Syslog parsing is of vital importance for the detection, diagnosis and prediction of network device failures in a datacenter. A common approach to syslog parsing is to extract templates from historical syslogs, after which syslogs are matched to these templates. To address the problems in the existing syslog parsing techniques, we propose a novel framework, Craftsman, which identifies frequent combinations of (syslog) words and then applies them as templates. Craftsman empirically extracts templates accurately, is extremely efficient in template matching, and naturally supports incremental learning. To compare the performance of Craftsman and three other template learning techniques designed for network devices, we experiment them on two-years’ worth of syslogs collected from network devices deployed across 10+ datacenters of a tier-one service provider. The experiments demonstrate that Craftsman achieves a close-to-one accuracy (as measured by rand index), and improves the computational efficiency by 6.88 to 10.25 times in template matching, and by 730 to 6847 times in syslog parsing. It also improves the accuracy (as measured by F1 measure) of failure prediction by 13.07% to 188%. In addition, we demonstrate Craftsman’s superior generality by comparing it with three widely-applied log parsing methods over five large log datasets collected from servers, distributed systems and applications."}
