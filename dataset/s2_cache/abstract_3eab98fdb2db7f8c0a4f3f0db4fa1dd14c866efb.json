{"abstract":"The Competition on Human Identification at a Distance 2021 (HID 2021) is to promote the research in human identification at a distance and to provide a benchmark to evaluate different methods. HID 2021 is the second follow-up from the first one, HID 2020. The dataset size and the evaluation protocal are the same with the previous competition, but the data in the test set has been changed. The paper firstly introduces the dataset and the evaluation protocol, then describes the methods from the top teams and their results. The methods show how to achieve state-of-the-art performance on gait recognition. The results in HID 2021 are better than those in HID 2020. From the comparisons and analysis, some useful conclusions can be drawn. We hope more improvements can be achieved by better followup competitions."}
