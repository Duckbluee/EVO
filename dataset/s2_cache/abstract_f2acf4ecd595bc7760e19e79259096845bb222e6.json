{"abstract":"Named Entity Recognition (NER) in low-resource settings aims to identify and categorize entities in a sentence with limited labeled data. Although prompt-based methods have succeeded in low-resource perspectives, challenges persist in effectively harnessing information and optimizing computational efficiency. In this work, we present a novel prompt-based method to enhance low-resource NER without exhaustive template tuning. First, we construct knowledge-enriched prompts by integrating representative entities and background information to provide informative supervision tailored to each entity type. Then, we introduce an efficient reverse generative framework inspired by question answering (QA), which avoids redundant computations. Finally, we reduce costs by generating entities from their types while retaining model reasoning capacity. Experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms other baselines on three datasets under few-shot settings."}
