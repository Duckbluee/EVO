{"abstract":"Face Forgery Detection (FFD), or Deepfake detection, aims to determine whether a digital face is real or fake. Due to different face synthesis algorithms with diverse forgery patterns, FFD models often overfit specific patterns in training datasets, resulting in poor generalization to other unseen forgeries. This severe challenge requires FFD models to possess strong capabilities in representing complex facial features and extracting subtle forgery cues. Although previous FFD models directly employ existing backbones to represent and extract facial forgery cues, the critical role of backbones is often overlooked, particularly as their knowledge and capabilities are insufficient to address FFD challenges, inevitably limiting generalization. Therefore, it is essential to integrate the backbone pre-training configurations and seek practical solutions by revisiting the complete FFD workflow, from backbone pre-training and fine-tuning to inference of discriminant results. Specifically, we analyze the crucial contributions of backbones with different configurations in FFD task and propose leveraging the ViT network with self-supervised learning on real-face datasets to pre-train a backbone, equipping it with superior facial representation capabilities. We then build a competitive backbone fine-tuning framework that strengthens the backbone's ability to extract diverse forgery cues within a competitive learning mechanism. Moreover, we devise a threshold optimization mechanism that utilizes prediction confidence to improve the inference reliability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our FFD model with the elaborate backbone achieves excellent performance in FFD and extra face-related tasks, i.e., presentation attack detection.
