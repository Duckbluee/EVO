{"abstract":"Distributed synchronous stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms are widely used in large-scale deep learning applications, while it is known that the communication bottleneck limits the scalability of the distributed system. Gradient sparsification is a promising technique to significantly reduce the communication traffic, while pipelining can further overlap the communications with computations. However, gradient sparsification introduces extra computation time, and pipelining requires many layer-wise communications which introduce significant communication startup overheads. Merging gradients from neighbor layers could reduce the startup overheads, but on the other hand it would increase the computation time of sparsification and the waiting time for the gradient computation. In this paper, we formulate the trade-off between communications and computations (including backward computation and gradient sparsification) as an optimization problem, and derive an optimal solution to the problem. We further develop the optimal merged gradient sparsification algorithm with SGD (OMGS-SGD) for distributed training of deep learning. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the convergence properties and scaling performance of OMGS-SGD. Experimental results show that OMGS-SGD achieves up to 31% end-to-end time efficiency improvement over the state-of-the-art sparsified SGD while preserving nearly consistent convergence performance with original SGD without sparsification on a 16-GPU cluster connected with 1Gbps Ethernet."}
