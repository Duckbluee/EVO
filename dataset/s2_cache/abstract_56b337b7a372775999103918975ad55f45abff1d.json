{"abstract":"Deep neural network-based object detectors are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Among existing works to fool object detectors, the camouflage-based method is more often adopted due to its adaptation to multi-view scenarios and non-planar objects. However, most of them can still be easily observed by human eyes, which limits their application in the real world. To fool human eyes and object detectors simultaneously, we propose a differential evolution based dual adversarial camouflage method. Specifically, we try to obtain the camouflage texture by the two-stage training, which can be wrapped over the surface of the object. In the first stage, we optimize the global texture to minimize the discrepancy between the rendered object and the scene background, making human eyes difficult to distinguish. In the second stage, we design three loss functions to optimize the local texture, which is selected from the global texture, making object detectors ineffective. In addition, we introduce the differential evolution algorithm to search for the near-optimal areas of the object to attack, improving the adversarial performance under certain attack area limitations. Experimental results show that our proposed method can obtain a good trade-off between fooling human eyes and object detectors under multiple specific scenes and objects."}
