{"abstract":"Recent years have witnessed fast developments of graph neural networks (GNNs) that have benefited myriads of graph analytic tasks and applications. In general, most GNNs depend on the homophily assumption that nodes belonging to the same class are more likely to be connected. However, as a ubiquitous graph property in numerous real-world scenarios, heterophily, i.e., nodes with different labels tend to be linked, significantly limits the performance of tailor-made homophilic GNNs. Hence, GNNs for heterophilic graphs are gaining increasing research attention to enhance graph learning with heterophily. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of GNNs for heterophilic graphs. Specifically, we propose a systematic taxonomy that essentially governs existing heterophilic GNN models, along with a general summary and detailed analysis. Furthermore, we discuss the correlation between graph heterophily and various graph research domains, aiming to facilitate the development of more effective GNNs across a spectrum of practical applications and learning tasks in the graph research community. In the end, we point out the potential directions to advance and stimulate more future research and applications on heterophilic graph learning with GNNs."}
