Its origins go back to at least the 1800s when people first started to investigate using photographs to measure the physical properties of the world. Since then, thousands of approaches have been explored. The classic geometric technique of Shape from Stereo is built on using geometry to define constraints on scene and camera deep learning without any attempt to explicitly model the geometry. In this survey, we explore geometry-inspired deep learning-based frameworks. We compare and contrast geometry enforcing constraints integrated into deep learning frameworks for depth estimation and other closely related vision tasks. We present a new taxonomy for prevalent geometry enforcing constraints used in modern deep learning frameworks. We also present insightful observations and potential future research directions."}
