{"abstract":"While we cannot efficiently emulate quantum algorithms on classical architectures, we can move the weight of complexity from time to hardware resources. This paper describes a proposition of a universal and scalable quantum computer emulator, in which the FPGA hardware emulates the behavior of a real quantum system, capable of running quantum algorithms while maintaining their natural time complexity. The article also shows the proposed quantum emulator architecture, exposing a standard programming interface, and working results of an implementation of an exemplary quantum algorithm."}
