{"abstract":"Complex multi-step reasoning tasks, such as solving mathematical problems or generating code, remain a significant hurdle for even the most advanced large language models (LLMs). Verifying LLM outputs with an Outcome Reward Model (ORM) is a standard inference-time technique aimed at enhancing the reasoning performance of LLMs. However, this still proves insufficient for reasoning tasks with a lengthy or multi-hop reasoning chain, where the intermediate outcomes are neither properly rewarded nor penalized. Process supervision addresses this limitation by assigning intermediate rewards during the reasoning process. To date, the methods used to collect process supervision data have relied on either human annotation or per-step Monte Carlo estimation, both prohibitively expensive to scale, thus hindering the broad application of this technique. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer style Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm named \\textit{OmegaPRM} for the efficient collection of high-quality process supervision data. This algorithm swiftly identifies the first error in the Chain of Thought (CoT) with binary search and balances the positive and negative examples, thereby ensuring both efficiency and quality. As a result, we are able to collect over 1.5 million process supervision annotations to train Process Reward Models (PRMs). This fully automated process supervision alongside the weighted self-consistency algorithm is able to enhance LLMs' math reasoning performances. We improved the success rates of the instruction-tuned Gemini Pro model from 51\\% to 69.4\\% on MATH500 and from 86.4\\% to 93.6\\% on GSM8K. Similarly, we boosted the success rates of Gemma2 27B from 42.3\\% to 58.2\\% on MATH500 and from 74.0\\% to 92.2\\% on GSM8K. The entire process operates without any human intervention or supervision, making our method both financially and ..."}
