{"abstract":"Recently, score-based diffusion models have shown satisfactory performance in MRI reconstruction. Most of these methods require a large amount of fully sampled MRI data as a training set, which, sometimes, is difficult to acquire in practice. This paper proposes a fully-sampled-data-free score-based diffusion model for MRI reconstruction, which learns the fully sampled MR image prior in a self-supervised manner on undersampled data. Specifically, we first infer the fully sampled MR image distribution from the undersampled data by Bayesian deep learning, then perturb the data distribution and approximate their probability density gradient by training a score function. Leveraging the learned score function as a prior, we can reconstruct the MR image by performing conditioned Langevin Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Experiments on the public dataset show that the proposed method outperforms existing self-supervised MRI reconstruction methods and achieves comparable performances with the conventional (fully sampled data trained) score-based diffusion methods."}
