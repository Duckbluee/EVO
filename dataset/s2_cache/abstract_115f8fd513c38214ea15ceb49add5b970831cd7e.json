{"abstract":"This paper reports on the development of a novel style guided diffusion model (SGDiff) which overcomes certain weaknesses inherent in existing models for image synthesis. The proposed SGDiff combines image modality with a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model to facilitate creative fashion image synthesis. It addresses the limitations of text-to-image diffusion models by incorporating supplementary style guidance, substantially reducing training costs, and overcoming the difficulties of controlling synthesized styles with text-only inputs. This paper also introduces a new dataset -- SG-Fashion, specifically designed for fashion image synthesis applications, offering high-resolution images and an extensive range of garment categories. By means of comprehensive ablation study, we examine the application of classifier-free guidance to a variety of conditions and validate the effectiveness of the proposed model for generating fashion images of the desired categories, product attributes, and styles. The contributions of this paper include a novel classifier-free guidance method for multi-modal feature fusion, a comprehensive dataset for fashion image synthesis application, a thorough investigation on conditioned text-to-image synthesis, and valuable insights for future research in the text-to-image synthesis domain.
