{"abstract":"In this article, we present a survey of mixed-initiative methods for the creation of content for video games. We also propose a definition of what mixed initiative implies, as the term lacks a clear specification. The survey includes works not directly aimed at video games but which create content that can potentially be used in games, such as art programs utilizing mixed initiative. Furthermore, we highlight research areas that overlap wholly or partly with mixed initiative, such as casual creators, explainable artificial intelligence, or interactive evolutionary computation. We examine these and several other topics in the context of mixed initiative. Finally, we provide a catalogue of typical techniques and challenges connected with mixed initiative before considering future directions."}
