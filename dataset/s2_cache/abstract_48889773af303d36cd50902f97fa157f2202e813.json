{"abstract":"Relationship-based access control (ReBAC) provides a high level of expressiveness and flexibility that promotes security and information sharing, by allowing policies to be expressed in terms of chains of relationships between entities. ReBAC policy mining algorithms have the potential to significantly reduce the cost of migration from legacy access control systems to ReBAC, by partially automating the development of a ReBAC policy. This paper presents new algorithms, called DTRM (Decision Tree ReBAC Miner) and DTRM-, based on decision trees, for mining ReBAC policies from access control lists (ACLs) and information about entities. Compared to state-of-the-art ReBAC mining algorithms, our algorithms are significantly faster, achieve comparable policy quality, and can mine policies in a richer language."}
