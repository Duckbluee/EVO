{"abstract":"We propose EnCLAP, a novel framework for automated audio captioning. EnCLAP employs two acoustic representation models, EnCodec and CLAP, along with a pretrained language model, BART. We also introduce a new training objective called masked codec modeling that improves acoustic awareness of the pretrained language model. Experimental results on AudioCaps and Clotho demonstrate that our model surpasses the performance of baseline models. Source code will be available at https://github.com/jaeyeonkim99/EnCLAP.1"}
