While previous surveys in the late 2010s covered the first stage of this revolution, the last five years of research brought further ground-breaking advancements to the field. This paper aims to fill this gap in a two-fold manner: first, we offer an in-depth examination of the latest developments in deep stereo matching, focusing on the pioneering architectural designs and groundbreaking paradigms that have redefined the field in the 2020s; second, we present a thorough analysis of the critical challenges that have emerged alongside these advances, providing a comprehensive taxonomy of these issues and exploring the state-of-the-art techniques proposed to address them. By reviewing both the architectural innovations and the key challenges, we offer a holistic view of deep stereo matching and highlight the specific areas that require further investigation. To accompany this survey, we maintain a regularly updated project page that catalogs papers on deep stereo matching in our Awesome-Deep-Stereo-Matching repository."}
