{"abstract":"Spectral graph theory is a vast and expanding area of combinatorics. We start these notes by introducing and motivating classical matrices associated with a graph, and then show how to derive combinatorial properties of a graph from the eigenvalues of these matrices. We then examine more modern results such as polynomial interlacing and high dimensional expanders"}
