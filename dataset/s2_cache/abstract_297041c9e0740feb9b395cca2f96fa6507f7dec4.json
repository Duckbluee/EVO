{"abstract":"Abstract The explosive growth of data leads researchers to waste time and energy to search for papers they need. Context-aware citation recommendation aims to solve this problem by analyzing a citation context and provides a list of recommended papers. In this paper, we propose a context-aware citation recommendation model based on end to end memory network. The model learns the representations of papers and citation contexts respectively based on bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). In particular, we jointly integrate author information and citation relationship in the distributed vector representations of citation contexts and papers. Then calculates the continuous relevance between them based on a computational multilayers memory network. We also conduct experiments on three real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of our model."}
