{"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new trading framework to apply deep actor critic methods to financial trading problems. Different from traditional actor critic methods, our model use not only actor but also critic to make the final decision. And for generalization purpose, a siamese structure in which the actor and the critic share the same LSTM features extraction part is adopted. The extracted features are then passed to different dense connected networks to compute q values and policy logits. The experiment results on different periods of CSI 300 prove that DACT has significantly better performances than B&H, DQT and DDRT. Furthermore, the idea of exploring based on the ensemble of actor and critic is valuable for other reinforcement learning problems."}
