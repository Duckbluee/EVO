{"abstract":"We propose a novel and unified method, measurement-conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic model (MC-DDPM), for under-sampled medical image reconstruction based on DDPM. Different from previous works, MC-DDPM is defined in measurement domain (e.g. k-space in MRI reconstruction) and conditioned on under-sampling mask. We apply this method to accelerate MRI reconstruction and the experimental results show excellent performance, outperforming full supervision baseline and the state-of-the-art score-based reconstruction method. Due to its generative nature, MC-DDPM can also quantify the uncertainty of reconstruction. Our code is available on github."}
