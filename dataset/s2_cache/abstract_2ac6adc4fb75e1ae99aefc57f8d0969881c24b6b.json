{"abstract":"This paper considers the problem of Byzantine fault-tolerance in distributed multi-agent optimization. In this problem, each agent has a local cost function. The goal of a distributed optimization algorithm is to allow the agents to collectively compute a minimum of their aggregate cost function. We consider the case when a certain number of agents may be Byzantine faulty. Such faulty agents may not follow a prescribed algorithm, and they may send arbitrary or incorrect information regarding their local cost functions. Unless a fault-tolerance mechanism is employed, traditional distributed optimization algorithms cannot tolerate such faulty agents. A reasonable goal in presence of faulty agents is to minimize the aggregate cost of the non-faulty agents. However, we show that this goal is impossible to achieve unless the cost functions of the non-faulty agents have a minimal redundancy property. We further propose a distributed optimization algorithm that allows the non-faulty agents to obtain a minimum of their aggregate cost if the minimal redundancy property holds. The scope of our algorithm is demonstrated through distributed sensing and learning applications, which are special cases of distributed optimization."}
