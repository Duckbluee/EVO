{"abstract":"In this paper, we study the problem of image-text matching. Inferring the latent semantic alignment between objects or other salient stuffs (e.g. snow, sky, lawn) and the corresponding words in sentences allows to capture fine-grained interplay between vision and language, and makes image-text matching more interpretable. Prior works either simply aggregate the similarity of all possible pairs of regions and words without attending differentially to more and less important words or regions, or use a multi-step attentional process to capture limited number of semantic alignments which is less interpretable. In this paper, we present Stacked Cross Attention to discover the full latent alignments using both image regions and words in sentence as context and infer the image-text similarity. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets. On Flickr30K, our approach outperforms the current best methods by 22.1% in text retrieval from image query, and 18.2% in image retrieval with text query (based on Recall@1). On MS-COCO, our approach improves sentence retrieval by 17.8% and image retrieval by 16.6% (based on Recall@1 using the 5K test set)."}
