{"abstract":"As voice assistants cement their place in our technologically advanced society, there remains a need to cater to the diverse linguistic landscape, including colloquial forms of low-resource languages. Our study introduces the first-ever comprehensive dataset for intent detection and slot filling in formal Bangla, colloquial Bangla, and Sylheti languages, totaling 984 samples across 10 unique intents. Our analysis reveals the robustness of large language models for tackling downstream tasks with inadequate data. The GPT-3.5 model achieves an impressive F1 score of 0.94 in intent detection and 0.51 in slot filling for colloquial Bangla."}
