{"abstract":"Throughout POL572 and 573, we will learn how to use various statistical methods in order to make causal inference , which is a main goal of social science research. We all know the mantra “correlation is not causation.” The diﬃculty of inferring causality arises from the fact that we do not observe counterfactual outcomes, which are required to estimate causal eﬀects. To formalize this intuition, we begin by describing the potential outcomes framework of causal inference."}
