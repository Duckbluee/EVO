{"abstract":"Mainstream deep models for three-dimensional MRI synthesis are either cross-sectional or volumetric depending on the input. Cross-sectional models can decrease the model complexity, but they may lead to discontinuity artifacts. On the other hand, volumetric models can alleviate the discontinuity artifacts, but they might suffer from loss of spatial resolution due to increased model complexity coupled with scarce training data. To mitigate the limitations of both approaches, we propose a novel model that progressively recovers the target volume via simpler synthesis tasks across individual orientations."}
