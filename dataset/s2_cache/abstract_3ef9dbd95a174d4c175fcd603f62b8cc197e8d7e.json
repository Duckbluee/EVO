{"abstract":"In this work, we introduce Janus-Pro, an advanced version of the previous work Janus. Specifically, Janus-Pro incorporates (1) an optimized training strategy, (2) expanded training data, and (3) scaling to larger model size. With these improvements, Janus-Pro achieves significant advancements in both multimodal understanding and text-to-image instruction-following capabilities, while also enhancing the stability of text-to-image generation. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in the field. Code and models are publicly available."}
