{"abstract":"The increasing use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in safety-critical systems has raised concerns about their potential for exhibiting ill-behaviors. While DNN verification and testing provide post hoc conclusions regarding unexpected behaviors, they do not prevent the erroneous behaviors from occurring. To address this issue, DNN repair/patch aims to eliminate unexpected predictions generated by defective DNNs. Two typical DNN repair paradigms are retraining and fine-tuning. However, existing methods focus on the high-level abstract interpretation or inference of state spaces, ignoring the underlying neurons' outputs. This renders patch processes computationally prohibitive and limited to piecewise linear (PWL) activation functions to great extent. To address these shortcomings, we propose a behavior-imitation based repair framework, BIRDNN, which integrates the two repair paradigms for the first time. BIRDNN corrects incorrect predictions of negative samples by imitating the closest expected behaviors of positive samples during the retraining repair procedure. For the fine-tuning repair process, BIRDNN analyzes the behavior differences of neurons on positive and negative samples to identify the most responsible neurons for the erroneous behaviors. To tackle more challenging domain-wise repair problems (DRPs), we synthesize BIRDNN with a domain behavior characterization technique to repair buggy DNNs in a probably approximated correct style. We also implement a prototype tool based on BIRDNN and evaluate it on ACAS Xu DNNs. Our experimental results show that BIRDNN can successfully repair buggy DNNs with significantly higher efficiency than state-of-the-art repair tools. Additionally, BIRDNN is highly compatible with different activation functions."}
