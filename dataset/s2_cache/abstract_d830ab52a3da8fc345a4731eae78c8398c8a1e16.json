{"abstract":"This article tackles the problem of multilabel learning with missing labels. For this problem, it is widely accepted that label correlations can be used to recover the ground-truth label matrix. Most of the existing approaches impose the low-rank assumption on the observed label matrix to exploit label correlations by decomposing it into two matrices, which describe the latent factors of instances and labels, respectively. The quality of these latent factors highly influences the recovery of ground-truth labels and the construction of the multilabel classification model. In this article, we propose recovering the ground-truth label matrix by regularized matrix factorization. Specifically, the latent factors of instances are regularized by the local topological structure derived from the feature space, which can be further used to induce an effective multilabel model. Moreover, the latent factors of labels and the label correlations are mutually adapted via label manifold regularization. In this way, the recovery of the ground-truth label matrix and the construction of the multilabel classification model are optimized jointly and can benefit from the regularized matrix factorization. Extensive experimental studies show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms on both full-label and missing-label data."}
