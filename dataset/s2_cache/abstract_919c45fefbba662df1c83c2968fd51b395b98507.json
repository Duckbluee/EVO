{"abstract":"Nowadays, the issue of information overload is gradually gaining exposure in the Internet of Things (IoT), calling for more research on recommender system in advance for industrial IoT scenarios. With the ever-increasing prevalence of various social networks, social recommendations (SoR) will certainly become an integral application that provides more feasibly personalized information service for future IoT users. However, almost all of the existing research managed to explore and quantify correlations between user preferences and social relationships, while neglecting the correlations among item features which could further influence the topologies of some social groups. To tackle with this challenge, in this article, a deep graph neural network-based social recommendation framework (GNN-SoR) is proposed for future IoTs. First, user and item feature spaces are abstracted as two graph networks and respectively encoded via the graph neural network method. Next, two encoded spaces are embedded into two latent factors of matrix factorization to complete missing rating values in a user-item rating matrix. Finally, a large amount of experiments are conducted on three real-world data sets to verify the efficiency and stability of the proposed GNN-SoR."}
