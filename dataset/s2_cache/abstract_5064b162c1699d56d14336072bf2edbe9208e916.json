{"abstract":"The degree of concentration, enthusiasm, optimism, and passion displayed by individual(s) while interacting with a machine is referred to as ‘user engagement’. Engagement comprises of behavioral, cognitive, and affect related cues [17]. To create engagement prediction systems that can work in real-world conditions, it is quintessential to learn from rich, diverse datasets. To this end, a large scale multi-faceted engagement in the wild dataset EngageNet is proposed. 31 hours duration data of 127 participants representing different illumination conditions are recorded. Thorough experiments are performed exploring the applicability of different features, action units, eye gaze, head pose, and MARLIN. Data from user interactions (question-answer) are analyzed to understand the relationship between effective learning and user engagement. To further validate the rich nature of the dataset, evaluation is also performed on the EngageWild dataset. The experiments show the usefulness of the proposed dataset. The code, models, and dataset link are publicly available at https://github.com/engagenet/engagenet_baselines."}
