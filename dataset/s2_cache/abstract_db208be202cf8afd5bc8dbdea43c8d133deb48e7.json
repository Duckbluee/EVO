{"abstract":"Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) excels at EEG recognition by capturing brain connections, but previous studies neglect the important EEG feature itself. In this study, we propose MSFR-GCN, a multi-scale feature reconstruction GCN for recognizing emotion and cognition tasks. Specifically, MSFR-GCN includes the MSFR and feature-pool characteristically, with the MSFR consisting of two sub-modules, multi-scale Squeeze-and-Excitation (MSSE) and multi-scale sample re-weighting (MSSR). MSSE assigns weights to channels and frequency bands based on their separate statistical information, while MSSR assigns sample weights based on combined channel and frequency information. The feature-pool, which pools across the feature dimension, is applied after GCN to retain EEG channel information. The MSFR-GCN achieves excellent results in emotion recognition when first tested on two public datasets, SEED and SEED-IV. Than the MSFR-GCN is tested on our self-collected Emotion and Cognition EEG dataset (ECED) for both emotion and cognition classification tasks. The results show MSFR-GCN’s good performance in emotion and cognition classification tasks and reveal the implicit relationship between the two, which may provide aid in the rehabilitation of people with cognitive impairments from an emotional perspective."}
