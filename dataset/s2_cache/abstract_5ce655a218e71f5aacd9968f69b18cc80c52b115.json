{"abstract":"Recent works reveal that network embedding techniques enable many machine learning models to handle diverse downstream tasks on graph-structured data. However, as previous methods usually focus on learning embedding for a single network, they cannot learn representations transferable on multiple networks. Hence, it is important to design a network embedding algorithm that supports downstream model transferring on different networks, known as domain adaptation. In this article, we propose a Domain Adaptive Network Embedding framework, which applies Graph Convolutional Network to learn transferable embedding. In DANE, nodes from multiple networks are encoded to vectors via a shared and aligned embedding space. The distribution of embedding on different networks are further aligned by Adversarial Learning Regularization. To achieve better performance in scenarios where labels are provided, DANE adopts a cross-entropy error term of the GCN framework and class centroid aligning method. Moreover, DANE's advantages in learning transferable network embedding can be guaranteed theoretically. Extensive experiments reflect that the proposed framework outperforms other well-recognized network embedding baselines in cross-network domain adaptation tasks, and the semi-supervised components improve the performance significantly."}
