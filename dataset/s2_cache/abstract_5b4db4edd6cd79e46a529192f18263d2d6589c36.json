{"abstract":"Recently, user cold-start recommendations have attracted a lot of attention from industry and academia. In user cold-start recommendation systems, the user attribute information is often used by existing approaches to learn user preferences due to the unavailability of user action data. However, most existing recommendation methods often ignore the sparsity of user attributes in cold-start recommendation systems. To tackle this limitation, this article proposes a novel Inductive Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (IHGNN) model, which utilizes the relational information in user cold-start recommendation systems to alleviate the sparsity of user attributes. Our model converts new users, items, and associated multimodal information into a Modality-aware Heterogeneous Graph (M-HG) that preserves the rich and heterogeneous relationship information among them. Specifically, to utilize rich and heterogeneous relational information in an M-HG for enriching the sparse attribute information of new users, we design a strategy based on random walk operations to collect associated neighbors of new users by multiple times sampling operation. Then, a well-designed multiple hierarchical attention aggregation model consisting of the intra- and inter-type attention aggregating module is proposed, focusing on useful connected neighbors and neglecting meaningless and noisy connected neighbors to generate high-quality representations for user cold-start recommendations. Experimental results on three real datasets demonstrate that the IHGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines."}
