{"abstract":"Traffic classification (TC) is pivotal for network traffic management and security. Over time, TC solutions leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) have undergone significant advancements, primarily fueled by machine learning (ML). This article analyzes the history and current state of AI-powered TC on the Internet, highlighting unresolved research questions. Indeed, despite extensive research, key desiderata goals to product-line implementations remain. AI presents untapped potential for addressing the complex and evolving challenges of TC, drawing from successful applications in other domains. We identify novel ML topics and solutions that address unmet TC requirements, shaping a comprehensive research landscape for the TC future. We also discuss the interdependence of TC desiderata and identify obstacles hindering AI-powered next-generation solutions. Overcoming these roadblocks will unlock two intertwined visions for future networks: self-managed and human-centered networks."}
