{"abstract":"Path of Destruction (PoD) is a self-supervised method for learning iterative generators. The core idea is to produce a training set by destroying a set of artifacts, and for each destructive step create a training instance based on the corresponding repair action. A generator trained on this dataset can then generate new artifacts by \"repairing\" from arbitrary states. The PoD method is very data-efficient in terms of original training examples and well-suited to functional artifacts composed of categorical data, such as game levels and discrete 3D structures. In this paper, we extend the Path of Destruction method to allow designer control over aspects of the generated artifacts. Controllability is introduced by adding conditional inputs to the state-action pairs that make up the repair trajectories. We test the controllable PoD method in a 2D dungeon setting, as well as in the domain of small 3D Lego cars."}
