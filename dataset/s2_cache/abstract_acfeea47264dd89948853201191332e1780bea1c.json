{"abstract":"Background Deep learning models have shown great success in automating tasks in sleep medicine by learning from carefully annotated electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, effectively using a large amount of raw EEG data remains a challenge. Objective In this study, we aim to learn robust vector representations from massive unlabeled EEG signals, such that the learned vectorized features (1) are expressive enough to replace the raw signals in the sleep staging task, and (2) provide better predictive performance than supervised models in scenarios involving fewer labels and noisy samples. Methods We propose a self-supervised model, Contrast with the World Representation (ContraWR), for EEG signal representation learning. Unlike previous models that use a set of negative samples, our model uses global statistics (ie, the average representation) from the data set to distinguish signals associated with different sleep stages. The ContraWR model is evaluated on 3 real-world EEG data sets that include both settings: at-home and in-laboratory EEG recording. Results ContraWR outperforms 4 recently reported self-supervised learning methods on the sleep staging task across 3 large EEG data sets. ContraWR also supersedes supervised learning when fewer training labels are available (eg, 4% accuracy improvement when less than 2% of data are labeled on the Sleep EDF data set). Moreover, the model provides informative, representative feature structures in 2D projection. Conclusions We show that ContraWR is robust to noise and can provide high-quality EEG representations for downstream prediction tasks. The proposed model can be generalized to other unsupervised physiological signal learning tasks. Future directions include exploring task-specific data augmentations and combining self-supervised methods with supervised methods, building upon the initial success of self-supervised learning reported in this study."}
