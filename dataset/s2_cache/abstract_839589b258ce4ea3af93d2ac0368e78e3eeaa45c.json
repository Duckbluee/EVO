{"abstract":"Obtaining demographic attributes of online users is of great significance for retail marketing, targeted advertisement and many other scenarios. Users' wanderings on various websites and applications contains user preference on different items, and can be leveraged to infer one's private attributes. Existing studies usually focus on manually defined features, relationships in online social networks, or modeling global user preferences. However, attribute inference from the most common behavioral data (e.g., browsing history, shopping cart) is recently overlooked, and still requires further research. In this work, we propose a Topic-Enhanced Attentive Recurrent Neural Network (TEA-RNN) model to capture both local neighborhood-based features (with attentive RNN) and global patterns (with topic model) within user behaviors, and apply multi-task learning mechanism with weighted losses to further leverage the latent relationships within demographics. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of TEA-RNN by comparing with several commonly used baselines."}
