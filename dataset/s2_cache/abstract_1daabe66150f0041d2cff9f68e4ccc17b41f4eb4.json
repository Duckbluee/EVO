{"abstract":"Abstract Nowadays, with increasing open knowledge graphs (KGs) being published on the Web, users depend on open data portals and search engines to find KGs. However, existing systems provide search services and present results with only metadata while ignoring the contents of KGs, i.e., triples. It brings difficulty for users' comprehension and relevance judgement. To overcome the limitation of metadata, in this paper we propose a content-based search engine for open KGs named CKGSE. Our system provides keyword search, KG snippet generation, KG profiling and browsing, all based on KGs' detailed, informative contents rather than their brief, limited metadata. To evaluate its usability, we implement a prototype with Chinese KGs crawled from OpenKG.CN and report some preliminary results and findings."}
