{"abstract":"This article investigates the resilient bipartite consensus problem for continuous-time second-order multiagent systems in the presence of totally bounded malicious nodes under signed digraphs. An event-based resilient impulsive algorithm is employed, which cannot only mitigate the malicious nodes’ influence on the convergence of normal ones but also reduce the communication loads of agents. A necessary and sufficient condition related to the network topology is established for solving resilient bipartite consensus by using system transformation. A numerical simulation illustrates the effectiveness of the result."}
