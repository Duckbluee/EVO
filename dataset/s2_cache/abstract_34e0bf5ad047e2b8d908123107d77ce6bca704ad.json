{"abstract":"When a robot aims to comprehend its human partner's request by identifying the referenced objects in Human-Robot Conversation, ambiguities can occur because the environment might contain many similar objects or the objects described in the request might be unknown to the robot. In the case of ambiguities, most of the systems ask users to repeat their request, which assumes that the robot is familiar with all of the objects in the environment. This assumption might lead to task failure, especially in complex real-world environments. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting an interactive system that asks for follow-up clarifications to disambiguate the described objects using the pieces of information that the robot could understand from the request and the objects in the environment that are known to the robot. To evaluate our system while disambiguating the referenced objects, we conducted a user study with 63 participants. We analyzed the interactions when the robot asked for clarifications and when it asked users to redescribe the same object. Our results show that generating followup clarification questions helped the robot correctly identify the described objects with fewer attempts (i.e., conversational turns). Also, when people were asked clarification questions, they perceived the task as easier, and they evaluated the task understanding and competence of the robot as higher. Our code and anonymized dataset are publicly available11https://github.com/IrmakDogan/Resolving-Ambiguities."}
