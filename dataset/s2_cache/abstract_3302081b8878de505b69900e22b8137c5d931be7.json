{"abstract":"Recently, there has been an increasing interest in (supervised) learning with graph data, especially using graph neural networks. However, the development of meaningful benchmark datasets and standardized evaluation procedures is lagging, consequently hindering advancements in this area. To address this, we introduce the TUDataset for graph classification and regression. The collection consists of over 120 datasets of varying sizes from a wide range of applications. We provide Python-based data loaders, kernel and graph neural network baseline implementations, and evaluation tools. Here, we give an overview of the datasets, standardized evaluation procedures, and provide baseline experiments. All datasets are available at this http URL. The experiments are fully reproducible from the code available at this http URL."}
