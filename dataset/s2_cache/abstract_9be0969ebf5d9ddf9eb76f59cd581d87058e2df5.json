{"abstract":"ABSTRACT Previous research shows that entrepreneurs create stories about their new organizations to convince key audiences of their legitimacy. However, over time, stories can become misaligned with changed circumstances. While entrepreneurs may modify the stories with which they present their organization to cope with these changes, preserving the continuity of the foundational stories that ensured success in the first place is essential to avoid audiences’ scepticism or distrust. Thus I decided to pursue the following research question: how do entrepreneurs modify their organizations’ stories to face changed circumstances, while also preserving continuity? My study suggests that to ensure continuity in the story, entrepreneurs should propose new meanings to previous narrative elements; bring changes to the plot by establishing relational links that provide a plausible explanation for the transition between stories; and reformulate the interplay between past, present and future."}
