{"abstract":"Representation learning for temporal knowledge graphs has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we study the problem of learning dynamic embeddings for temporal knowledge graphs. We address this problem by proposing a Dynamic Bayesian Knowledge Graphs Embedding model (DBKGE), which is able to dynamically track the semantic representations of entities over time in a joint metric space and make predictions for the future. Unlike other temporal knowledge graph embedding methods, DBKGE is a novel probabilistic representation learning method that aims at inferring dynamic embeddings of entities in a streaming scenario. To obtain high-quality embeddings and model their uncertainty, our DBKGE embeds entities with means and variances of Gaussian distributions. Based on amortized inference, an online inference algorithm is proposed to jointly learn the latent representations of entities and smooth their changes across time. Experiments on Yago and Wiki datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art static and temporal knowledge graph embedding models."}
