Clustering mainly deals with grouping of variables based upon similar characteristics. Classification models are experienced by comparing the predicted values to that of the known target values in a set of test data. Data classification has many applications in business modeling, marketing analysis, credit risk analysis; biomedical engineering and drug retort modeling. The extension of data analysis and classification makes the insight into big data with an exploration to processing and managing large data sets. This chapter deals with various techniques, methodologies that correspond to the classification problem in data analysis process and its methodological impacts to big data."}
