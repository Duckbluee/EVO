{"abstract":"A distributed event-triggered controller is developed for approximate leader-follower consensus while being robust to Byzantine agents for a homogeneous multi-agent system (MAS). The event-triggered strategy enables intermittent communication and sensing. Moreover, each agent can detect Byzantine adversaries within their neighbor set and selectively disregard their transmission to achieve approximate leader-follower consensus. A non-smooth Lyapunov stability analysis is leveraged to prove consensus of the MAS."}
