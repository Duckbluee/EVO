{"abstract":"The field of education has undergone a significant transformation due to the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Among the various AI technologies, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) have emerged as powerful visualization tools for integrating multi-faceted information. In the context of university education, the availability of numerous specialized courses and complicated learning resources often leads to inferior learning outcomes for students. In this paper, we propose an automated framework for knowledge extraction, visual KG construction, and graph fusion, tailored for the major of Electronic Information. Furthermore, we perform data analysis to investigate the correlation degree and relationship between courses, rank hot knowledge concepts, and explore the intersection of courses. Our objective is to enhance the learning efficiency of students and to explore new educational paradigms enabled by AI. The proposed framework is expected to enable students to better understand and appreciate the intricacies of their field of study by providing them with a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between the various concepts and courses."}
