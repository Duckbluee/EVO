{"abstract":"Information Extraction (IE) stands as a cornerstone in natural language processing, traditionally segmented into distinct sub-tasks. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) heralds a paradigm shift, suggesting the feasibility of a singular model addressing multiple IE subtasks. However, the efficacy of employing LLMs directly trained on chat-based data for IE tasks is considerably subpar when juxtaposed with conventional methods employed in prior studies. In order to address this limitation and harness the robust generalization capabilities inherent in LLMs, we propose the General Information Extraction Large Language Model (GIELLM). GIELLM seamlessly integrates various tasks, including Text Classification, Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, and Event Extraction, employing a unified input-output schema. This innovation marks the first instance of a model simultaneously handling such a diverse array of IE subtasks. Notably, the GIELLM leverages the Mutual Reinforcement Effect (MRE), enhancing performance in integrated tasks compared to their isolated counterparts. Our experiments demonstrate State-of-the-Art (SOTA) results in five out of six Japanese mixed datasets, significantly surpassing GPT-3.5-Turbo. Further, an independent evaluation using the novel Text Classification Relation and Event Extraction(TCREE) dataset corroborates the synergistic advantages of MRE in text and word classification. This breakthrough paves the way for most IE subtasks to be subsumed under a singular LLM framework. Specialized fine-tune task-specific models are no longer needed."}
