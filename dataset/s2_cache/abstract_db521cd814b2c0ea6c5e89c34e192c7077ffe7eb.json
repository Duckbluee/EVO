{"abstract":"This paper presents an overview and comparative study of the state of the art in State-Order Reduction (SOR) and Scheduling Dimension Reduction (SDR) for Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) State-Space (SS) models, comparing and benchmarking their capabilities, limitations and performance. The use case chosen for these studies is an interconnected network of nonlinear coupled mass spring damper systems with three different configurations, where some spring coefficients are described by arbitrary user-defined static nonlinear functions. For SOR, the following methods are compared: Linear Time-Invariant (LTI), LPV and LFR-based balanced reductions, moment matching and parameter-varying oblique projection. For SDR, the following methods are compared: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), trajectory PCA, Kernel PCA and LTI balanced truncation, autoencoders and deep neural network. The comparison reveals the most suitable reduction methods for the different benchmark configurations, from which we provide use case SOR and SDR guidelines that can be used to choose the best reduction method for a given LPV-SS model."}
