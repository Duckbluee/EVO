{"abstract":"Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as state-of-the-art models for various vision tasks recently. However, their heavy computation costs remain daunting for resource-limited devices. To address this, researchers have dedicated themselves to compressing redundant information in ViTs for acceleration. However, existing approaches generally sparsely drop redundant image tokens by token pruning or brutally remove channels by channel pruning, leading to a sub-optimal balance between model performance and inference speed. Moreover, they struggle when transferring compressed models to downstream vision tasks that require the spatial structure of images, such as semantic segmentation. To tackle these issues, we propose CAIT, a joint compression method for ViTs that achieves a harmonious blend of high accuracy, fast inference speed, and favorable transferability to downstream tasks. Specifically, we introduce an asymmetric token merging (ATME) strategy to effectively integrate neighboring tokens. It can successfully compress redundant token information while preserving the spatial structure of images. On top of it, we further design a consistent dynamic channel pruning (CDCP) strategy to dynamically prune unimportant channels in ViTs. Thanks to CDCP, insignificant channels in multi-head self-attention modules of ViTs can be pruned uniformly, significantly enhancing the model compression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance across various ViTs."}
