{"abstract":"Federated learning allows edge devices to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their local private data. Yet, with limited network bandwidth at the edge, communication often becomes a severe bottleneck. In this article, we find that it is unnecessary to always synchronize the full model in the entire training process, because many parameters already become mature (i.e., stable) prior to model convergence, and can thus be excluded from later synchronizations. This allows us to reduce the communication overhead without compromising the model accuracy. However, challenges are that the local parameters excluded from global synchronization may diverge on different clients, and meanwhile some parameters may stabilize only temporally. To address these challenges, we propose a novel scheme called Adaptive Parameter Freezing (APF), which fixes (freezes) the non-synchronized stable parameters in intermittent periods. Specifically, the freezing periods are tentatively adjusted in an additively-increase and multiplicatively-decrease manner—depending on whether the previously-frozen parameters remain stable in subsequent iterations. We also extend APF into APF# and APF++, which freeze parameters in a more aggressive manner to achieve larger performance benefit for large complex models. We implemented APF and its variants as Python modules with PyTorch, and extensive experiments show that APF can reduce data transfer amount by over <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$60\\%$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mn>60</mml:mn><mml:mo>%</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"li-ieq1-3241965.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula>."}
