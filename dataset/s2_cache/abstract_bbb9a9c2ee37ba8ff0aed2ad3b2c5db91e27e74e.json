{"abstract":"Irreversible vision loss is a worldwide threat. Developing a computer-aided diagnosis system to detect retinal fundus diseases is extremely useful and serviceable to ophthalmologists. Early detection, diagnosis, and correct treatment could save the eye’s vision. Nevertheless, an eye may be afflicted with several diseases if proper care is not taken. A single retinal fundus image might be linked to one or more diseases. Age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, Glaucoma, and uncorrected refractive errors are the leading causes of visual impairment. Our research team at the center of excellence lab has generated a new dataset called the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset 2.0 (RFMiD2.0). This dataset includes around 860 retinal fundus images, annotated by three eye specialists, and is a multiclass, multilabel dataset. We gathered images from a research facility in Jalna and Nanded, where patients across Maharashtra come for preventative and therapeutic eye care. Our dataset would be the second publicly available dataset consisting of the most frequent diseases, along with some rarely identified diseases. This dataset is auxiliary to the previously published RFMiD dataset. This dataset would be significant for the research and development of artificial intelligence in ophthalmology."}
