{"abstract":"Large-scale diffusion models, known for their impressive image generation capabilities, have raised concerns among researchers regarding social impacts, such as the imitation of copyrighted artistic styles. In response, existing approaches turn to machine unlearning techniques to eliminate unsafe concepts from pre-trained models. However, these methods compromise the generative performance and neglect the coupling among multi-concept erasures, as well as the concept restoration problem. To address these issues, we propose a Separable Multi-concept Eraser (SepME), which mainly includes two parts: the generation of concept-irrelevant representations and the weight decoupling. The former aims to avoid unlearning substantial information that is irrelevant to forgotten concepts. The latter separates optimizable model weights, making each weight increment correspond to a specific concept erasure without affecting generative performance on other concepts. Specifically, the weight increment for erasing a specified concept is formulated as a linear combination of solutions calculated based on other known undesirable concepts. Extensive experiments indicate the efficacy of our approach in eliminating concepts, preserving model performance, and offering flexibility in the erasure or recovery of various concepts."}
