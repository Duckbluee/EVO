{"abstract":"This letter presents guarantees to satisfy resilience on the communication network of robot formations. In these resilient networks, cooperative robots can achieve consensus in the presence of faulty or malicious robots. We propose a design framework on triangular and square lattices, providing an underlying structure for proximity-based robot networks. We present sufficient conditions on the robot communication range to guarantee resilient consensus. Our results can be used to design robot formations considering obstacles, number of robots, and energy usage. Additionally, robot networks with homogeneous and heterogeneous communication range are studied. We support our theoretical analysis with simulations on selected scenarios."}
