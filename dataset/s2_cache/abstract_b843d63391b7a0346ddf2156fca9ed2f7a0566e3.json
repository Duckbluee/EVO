{"abstract":"This study discusses the ethical use of geographical information systems (GIS) data with a focus on geomasking for upholding locational privacy. As part of a pilot study in Jeddah City, Saudi Arabia, we used open-source geomasking methods to ensure geoprivacy while examining built environment features that determine the quality of life among individuals with type-II diabetes. We employed the open-source algorithms Maskmy.XYZ and NRand-k for geomasking 329 data points. The results showed no differences between global and city-level spatial patterns, but significant variations were observed with respect to local patterns. These findings indicate the promising potential of the chosen geomasking technologies with respect to ensuring locational privacy but it was noted that further improvements are needed. We recommend developing enhanced algorithms and conducting additional studies to minimize any negative impact of geomasking in spatial analysis with the overall aim of achieving a better understanding of ethical considerations in GIS sciences. In conclusion, application of geomasking is straightforward and can lead to enhanced use for privacy protection in geospatial data analysis."}
