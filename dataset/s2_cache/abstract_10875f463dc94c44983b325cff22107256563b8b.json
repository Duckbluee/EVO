{"abstract":"The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a significant challenge: the exhausting of publicly available fresh data. This is because training a LLM needs a large demanding of new data. Federated learning emerges as a promising solution, enabling collaborative model to contribute their private data to LLM global model. However, integrating federated learning with LLMs introduces new challenges, including the lack of transparency and the need for effective unlearning mechanisms. Transparency is essential to ensuring trust and fairness among participants, while accountability is crucial for deterring malicious behaviour and enabling corrective actions when necessary. To address these challenges, we propose a novel blockchain-based federated learning framework for LLMs that enhances transparency, accountability, and unlearning capabilities. Our framework leverages blockchain technology to create a tamper-proof record of each model's contributions and introduces an innovative unlearning function that seamlessly integrates with the federated learning mechanism. We investigate the impact of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) hyperparameters on unlearning performance and integrate Hyperledger Fabric to ensure the security, transparency, and verifiability of the unlearning process. Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we showcase the effectiveness of our proposed framework in achieving highly effective unlearning in LLMs trained using federated learning. Our findings highlight the feasibility of integrating blockchain technology into federated learning frameworks for LLMs."}
