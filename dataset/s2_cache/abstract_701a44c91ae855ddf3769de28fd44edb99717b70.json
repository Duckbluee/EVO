{"abstract":"Language models (LM) are becoming prevalent in many language-based application spaces globally. Although these LMs are improving our day-to-day interactions with digital prod-ucts, concerns remain whether open-ended languages or text generated from these models reveal any biases toward a speciﬁc group of people, thereby risking the usability of a certain product. There is a need to identify whether these models possess bias to improve the fairness in these models. This gap motivates our ongoing work, where we measured the two aspects of bias in GPT-3 generated text through a disability lens. techniques: sentiment analysis and toxicity, to identify the bias inherited in GPT-3. A dataset adapted from Hassan et al. (2021) has been employed as a test-bed for this ex-periment. Our preliminary ﬁndings from this initial exploration demonstrate how GPT-3 possesses certain bias towards people who are Deaf or Blind while generating open-ended text."}
