{"abstract":"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in marine Internet of Things (MIoTs) have become an important paradigm for marine environment exploration. However, in MIoTs, when collecting environmental information, USVs face a series of threats, such as engine failure, grounding, collision, etc., resulting in damage to shipboard memory, vessel breakage and sinking, which may cause loss or damage of stored data. The USV fleet consisting of multiple USVs is recently advocated to enable collaborative communication and storage resource sharing. As such, in this article, the USV fleet-assisted data backup scheme for the damaged USVs is proposed to guarantee the availability of stored data. First, a data backup framework for USV fleets is designed, where the USVs are classified into high-risk USVs and low-risk USVs according to the damage risk probability of sailing. Within the USV fleet, high-risk USVs (i.e., requesters) back up data to low-risk USVs (i.e., assistants) during emergency times. Second, the coalition game based on cost sharing is utilized to incentivize individual USVs to form the optimal USV fleets by maximizing the expected revenues, where the cost sharing fashion effectively ensures the stability of the coalitions. Finally, the joint optimization problem of the requesters’ allocating data decisions and the assistants’ receiving data decisions is formulated to maximize the average amount of data backup. The predictor-corrector interior point method (PIPM) and Q-learning method are leveraged to derive the reasonable solution for the formulated problem, with achieving the optimal allocating data decision and receiving data decision. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of individual expected revenue, participation degree and the average amount of data backup."}
