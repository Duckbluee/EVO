{"abstract":"Ensuring traffic safety and mitigating accidents in modern driving is of paramount importance, and computer vision technologies have the potential to significantly contribute to this goal. This paper presents a multi-modal Vision Transformer for Driver Distraction Detection (termed ViT-DD), which incorporates inductive information from training signals related to both distraction detection and driver emotion recognition. Additionally, a self-learning algorithm is developed, allowing for the seamless integration of driver data without emotion labels into the multi-task training process of ViT-DD. Experimental results reveal that the proposed ViT-DD surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods for driver distraction detection by 6.5% and 0.9% on the SFDDD and AUCDD datasets, respectively."}
