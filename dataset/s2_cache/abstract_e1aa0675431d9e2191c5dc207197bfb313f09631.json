{"abstract":"Research on fairness in machine learning has been recently extended to recommender systems. One of the factors that may impact fairness is bias disparity, the degree to which a group's preferences on various item categories fail to be reflected in the recommendations they receive. In some cases biases in the original data may be amplified or reversed by the underlying recommendation algorithm. In this paper, we explore how different recommendation algorithms reflect the tradeoff between ranking quality and bias disparity. Our experiments include neighborhood-based, model-based, and trust-aware recommendation algorithms."}
