{"abstract":"Deepfake detection methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have demonstrated high accuracy. \\textcolor{black}{However, these methods often suffer from decreased performance when faced with unknown forgery methods and common transformations such as resizing and blurring, resulting in deviations between training and testing domains.} This phenomenon, known as overfitting, poses a significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a novel block shuffling regularization method. Firstly, our approach involves dividing the images into blocks and applying both intra-block and inter-block shuffling techniques. This process indirectly achieves weight-sharing across different dimensions. Secondly, we introduce an adversarial loss algorithm to mitigate the overfitting problem induced by the shuffling noise. Finally, we restore the spatial layout of the blocks to capture the semantic associations among them. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which surpasses existing approaches in forgery face detection. Notably, our method exhibits excellent generalization capabilities, demonstrating robustness against cross-dataset evaluations and common image transformations. Especially our method can be easily integrated with various CNN models. Source code is available at \\href{https://github.com/NoWindButRain/BlockShuffleLearning}{Github}."}
