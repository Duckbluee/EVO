{"abstract":"It is promising to deploy CNN inference on local end-user devices for high-accuracy and time-sensitive applications. Model parallelism has the potential to provide high throughput and low latency in distributed CNN inference. However, it is non-trivial to use model parallelism as the original CNN model is inherently tightly-coupled structure. In this article, we propose DeCNN, a more effective inference approach that uses decoupled CNN structure to optimize model parallelism for distributed inference on end-user devices. DeCNN is novel consisting of three schemes. Scheme-1 is structure-level optimization. It exploits group convolution and channel shuffle to decouple the original CNN structure for model parallelism. Scheme-2 is partition-level optimization. It is based on channel group to partition the convolutional layers, and then leverages input-based method to partition the fully connected layers, further exposing high degree of parallelism. Scheme-3 is communication-level optimization. It uses inter-sample parallelism to hide communications for better performance and robustness, especially in the weak network connections. We use ImageNet classification task to evaluate the effectiveness of DeCNN on a distributed multi-ARM platform. Notably, when using the number of devices from 1 to 4, DeCNN can accelerate the inference of large-scale ResNet-50 by 3.21×, and reduce 65.3 percent memory footprint, with 1.29 percent accuracy improvement."}
