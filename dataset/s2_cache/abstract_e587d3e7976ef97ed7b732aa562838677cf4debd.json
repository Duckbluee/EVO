{"abstract":"Gait recognition, which is a biometric identifier for individual walking patterns, is utilized in many applications, such as criminal investigation and identification systems, because it can be applied at a long distance and requires no explicit cooperation of the subjects. In general, cameras are used for gait recognition, and several methods in previous studies have used depth information captured by RGB-D cameras. However, RGB-D cameras are limited in terms of their measurement distance and are difficult to access outdoors. In recent years, real-time multi-layer 3D LiDAR, which can obtain 3D range images of a target at ranges of over 100 m, has attracted significant attention for use in autonomous mobile robots, serving as eyes for obstacles detection and navigation. Compared with cameras, such 3D LiDAR has rarely been used for biometrics owing to its low spatial resolution. However, considering the unique characteristics of 3D LiDAR, such as the robustness of the illumination conditions, long measurement distances, and wide-angle scanning, the approach has the potential to be applied outdoors as a biometric identifier. The present paper describes a gait recognition system, called 2V-Gait, which is robust to variations in the walking direction of a subject and the distance measured from the 3D LiDAR. To improve the performance of gait recognition, we leverage the unique characteristics of 3D LiDAR, which are not included in regular cameras. Extensive experiments on our dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}
