{"abstract":"Malicious Deepfakes have led to a sharp conflict over distinguishing between genuine and forged faces. Although many countermeasures have been developed to detect Deepfakes ex-post, undoubtedly, passive forensics has not considered any preventive measures for the pristine face before foreseeable manipulations. To complete this forensics ecosystem, we thus put forward the proactive solution dubbed SepMark, which provides a unified framework for source tracing and Deepfake detection. SepMark originates from encoder-decoder-based deep watermarking but with two separable decoders. For the first time the deep separable watermarking, SepMark brings a new paradigm to the established study of deep watermarking, where a single encoder embeds one watermark elegantly, while two decoders can extract the watermark separately at different levels of robustness. The robust decoder termed Tracer that resists various distortions may have an overly high level of robustness, allowing the watermark to survive both before and after Deepfake. The semi-robust one termed Detector is selectively sensitive to malicious distortions, making the watermark disappear after Deepfake. Only SepMark comprising of Tracer and Detector can reliably trace the trusted source of the marked face and detect whether it has been altered since being marked; neither of the two alone can achieve this. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SepMark on typical Deepfakes, including face swapping, expression reenactment, and attribute editing.
