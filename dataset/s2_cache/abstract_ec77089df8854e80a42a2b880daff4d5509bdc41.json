{"abstract":"Notwithstanding the tremendous success of deep neural networks in a range of realms, previous studies have shown that these learning models are exposed to an inherent hazard called adversarial example — images to which an elaborate perturbation is maliciously added could deceive a network, which entails the study of countermeasures urgently. However, existing solutions suffer from some weaknesses, e.g., parameters are usually determined empirically in some processing-based detection methods might result in a sub-optimal effect, and the directly performed processing on images might affect the classification of benign samples, leading to increment of false positive. In this paper, we propose a novel imAge-DepenDent noIse reducTION (ADDITION) model based on deep learning for adversarial detection. The ADDITION model can adaptively convert the adversarial perturbation in each image to approximate Gaussian noise by injecting image-dependent additional noise, then perform noise reduction to eliminate the adversarial perturbation, and finally detect adversarial examples by examining the classification inconsistency between the input image and its denoised version. The ADDITION model is trained end-to-end on benign samples without any prior knowledge of adversarial attacks, and thus avoid time-consuming task of generating adversarial examples in practical use. We generate more than 220,000 adversarial examples based on six attack algorithms for evaluation and present state-of-the-art comparisons on three real-word datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves improved performance in both detection accuracy rate and false positive rate."}
