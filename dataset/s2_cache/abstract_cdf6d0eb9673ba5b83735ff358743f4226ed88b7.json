{"abstract":"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in vision-related tasks, capitalizing on their visual semantic comprehension and reasoning capabilities. However, their ability to detect subtle visual spoofing and forgery clues in face attack detection tasks remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark, SHIELD, to evaluate MLLMs for face spoofing and forgery detection. Specifically, we design true/false and multiple-choice questions to assess MLLM performance on multimodal face data across two tasks. For the face anti-spoofing task, we evaluate three modalities (i.e., RGB, infrared, and depth) under six attack types. For the face forgery detection task, we evaluate GAN-based and diffusion-based data, incorporating visual and acoustic modalities. We conduct zero-shot and few-shot evaluations in standard and chain of thought (COT) settings. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-attribute chain of thought (MA-COT) paradigm for describing and judging various task-specific and task-irrelevant attributes of face images. The findings of this study demonstrate that MLLMs exhibit strong potential for addressing the challenges associated with the security of facial recognition technology applications."}
