{"abstract":"DeepTensor is a computationally efficient framework for low-rank decomposition of matrices and tensors using deep generative networks. We decompose a tensor as the product of low-rank tensor factors (e.g., a matrix as the outer product of two vectors), where each low-rank tensor is generated by a deep network (DN) that is trained in a self-supervised manner to minimize the mean-square approximation error. Our key observation is that the implicit regularization inherent in DNs enables them to capture nonlinear signal structures (e.g., manifolds) that are out of the reach of classical linear methods like the singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal components analysis (PCA). Furthermore, in contrast to the SVD and PCA, whose performance deteriorates when the tensor’s entries deviate from additive white Gaussian noise, we demonstrate that the performance of DeepTensor is robust to a wide range of distributions. We validate that DeepTensor is a robust and computationally efficient drop-in replacement for the SVD, PCA, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), and similar decompositions by exploring a range of real-world applications, including hyperspectral image denoising, 3D MRI tomography, and image classification. In particular, DeepTensor offers a 6 dB signal-to-noise ratio improvement over standard denoising methods for signal corrupted by Poisson noise and learns to decompose 3D tensors 60 times faster than a single DN equipped with 3D convolutions."}
