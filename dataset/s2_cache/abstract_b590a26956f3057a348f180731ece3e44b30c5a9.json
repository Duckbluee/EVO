{"abstract":"The impressive performances of large language models (LLMs) and their immense potential for commercialization have given rise to serious concerns over the intellectual property (IP) of their training data. In particular, the synthetic texts generated by LLMs may infringe the IP of the data being used to train the LLMs. To this end, it is imperative to be able to (a) identify the data provider who contributed to the generation of a synthetic text by an LLM (source attribution) and (b) verify whether the text data from a data provider has been used to train an LLM (data provenance). In this paper, we show that both problems can be solved by watermarking, i.e., by enabling an LLM to generate synthetic texts with embedded watermarks that contain information about their source(s). We identify the key properties of such watermarking frameworks (e.g., source attribution accuracy, robustness against adversaries), and propose a WAtermarking for Source Attribution (WASA) framework that satisfies these key properties due to our algorithmic designs. Our WASA framework enables an LLM to learn an accurate mapping from the texts of different data providers to their corresponding unique watermarks, which sets the foundation for effective source attribution (and hence data provenance). Extensive empirical evaluations show that our WASA framework achieves effective source attribution and data provenance."}
