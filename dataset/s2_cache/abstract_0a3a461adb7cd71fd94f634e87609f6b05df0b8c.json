{"abstract":"With the development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology, various types of information, such as social resources and physical resources, are deeply integrated for different comprehensive applications. Social networking, car networking, medical services, video surveillance, and other forms of the IoT information service model gradually change people’s daily lives. Facing the vast amounts of IoT information data, the IoT search technology is used to quickly find accurate information to meet the real-time search needs of users. However, IoT search requires using a large amount of user private information, such as personal health information, location information, and social relations information, to provide personalized services. Employing private information from users will encounter security problems if an effective access control mechanism is missing during the IoT search process. An access control mechanism can effectively monitor the access activities of resources and ensure that authorized users access information resources under legitimate conditions. This survey examines the growing literature on access control for an IoT search. Problems and challenges of access control mechanisms are analyzed to facilitate the adoption of access control solutions in real-life settings. This article aims to provide theoretical, methodological, and technical guidance for IoT search access control mechanisms in large-scale dynamic heterogeneous environments. Based on a literature review, we also analyzed the future development direction of access control in the age of IoT."}
