{"abstract":"Semantic networks, exemplified by the knowledge graph, serve as a means to represent knowledge by leveraging the structure of a graph. While the knowledge graph exhibits promising potential in the field of natural language processing, it suffers from incompleteness. This article focuses on the task of completing knowledge graphs by predicting linkages between entities, which is fundamental yet critical. Traditional methods based on translational distance struggle when dealing with unseen entities. In contrast, semantic matching presents itself as a potential solution due to its ability to handle such cases. However, semantic matching-based approaches necessitate large-scale datasets for effective training, which are typically unavailable in practical scenarios, hindering their competitive performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel architecture for knowledge graphs known as LP-BERT, which incorporates a language model. LP-BERT consists of two primary stages: multi-task pre-training and knowledge graph fine-tuning. During the pre-training phase, the model acquires relationship information from triples by predicting either entities or relations through three distinct tasks. In the fine-tuning phase, we introduce a batch-based triple-style negative sampling technique inspired by contrastive learning. This method significantly increases the proportion of negative sampling while maintaining a nearly unchanged training time. Furthermore, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that leverages the inverse relationship of triples to enhance both the performance and robustness of the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conduct extensive experiments on three widely used knowledge graph datasets: WN18RR, FB15k-237, and UMLS. The experimental results showcase the superiority of our methods, with LP-BERT achieving state-of-the-art performance on the WN18RR and FB15k-237 datasets."}
