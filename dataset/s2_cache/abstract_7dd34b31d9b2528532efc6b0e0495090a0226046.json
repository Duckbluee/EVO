{"abstract":"Nowadays, forgery faces pose pressing security concerns over fake news, fraud, impersonation, etc. Despite the demonstrated success in intra-domain face forgery detection, existing detection methods lack generalization capability and tend to suffer from dramatic performance drops when deployed to unforeseen domains. To mitigate this issue, this paper designs a more general fake face detection model based on the vision transformer(ViT) architecture. In the training phase, the pretrained ViT weights are freezed, and only the Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA) modules are updated. Additionally, the Single Center Loss(SCL) is applied to supervise the training process, further improving the generalization capability of the model. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-arts detection performances in both cross-manipulation and cross-dataset evaluations."}
