{"abstract":"Recommender systems relieve users from cognitive overloading by predicting preferred items for users. Due to the complexity of interactions between users and items, graph neural networks (GNN) use graph structures to effectively model user–item interactions. However, existing GNN approaches have the following limitations: (1) User reviews are not adequately modeled in graphs. Therefore, user preferences and item properties that are described in user reviews are lost for modeling users and items; and (2) GNNs assume deterministic relations between users and items, which lack the stochastic modeling to estimate the uncertainties in neighbor relations. To mitigate the limitations, we build tripartite graphs to model user reviews as nodes that connect with users and items. We estimate neighbor relations with stochastic variables and propose a Bayesian graph attention network (i.e., ContGraph) to accurately predict user ratings. ContGraph incorporates the prior knowledge of user preferences to regularize the posterior inference of attention weights. Our experimental results show that ContGraph significantly outperforms 13 state-of-the-art models and improves the best performing baseline (i.e., ANR) by 5.23% on 25 datasets in the five-core version. Moreover, we show that correctly modeling the semantics of user reviews in graphs can help express the semantics of users and items."}
