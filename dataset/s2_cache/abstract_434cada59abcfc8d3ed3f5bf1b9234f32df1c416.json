{"abstract":"Tests suites are a key ingredient in various software automation tasks. Recently, various studies [4] have demonstrated that they are paramount in the adoption of latest innovations in software engineering, such as automated program repair (APR) [3]. Test suites are unfortunately often too scarce in software development projects. Generally, they are provided for regression testing, while new bugs are discovered by users who then describe them infor-mally in bug reports. In recent literature, a new trend of research in APR has attempted to leverage bug reports in generate-and-validate pipelines for program repair. Even in such cases, when an APR tool generates a patch candidate, if test cases are unavailable, developers must manually validate the patch, leading to a threat to validity."}
