{"abstract":"Knowledge graph, or knowledge base, plays an important role in a variety of applications in the field of artificial intelligence. In both research and application of knowledge graph, knowledge representation learning is one of the fundamental tasks. Existing representation learning approaches are mainly based on structural knowledge between entities and relations, while knowledge among entities per se is largely ignored. Though a few approaches integrated entity knowledge while learning representations, these methods lack the flexibility to apply to multimodalities. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a new representation learning method, TransAE, by combining multimodal autoencoder with TransE model, where TransE is a simple and effective representation learning method for knowledge graphs. In TransAE, the hidden layer of autoencoder is used as the representation of entities in the TransE model, thus it encodes not only the structural knowledge, but also the multimodal knowledge, such as visual and textural knowledge, into the final representation. Compared with traditional methods based on only structural knowledge, TransAE can significantly improve the performance in the sense of link prediction and triplet classification. Also, TransAE has the ability to learn representations for entities out of knowledge base in zero-shot. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TransAE method."}
