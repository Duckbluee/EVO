{"abstract":"Generative models now produce images with such stunning realism that they can easily deceive the human eye. While this progress unlocks vast creative potential, it also presents significant risks, such as the spread of misinformation. Consequently, detecting generated images has become a critical research challenge. However, current detection methods are often plagued by low accuracy and poor generalization. In this paper, to address these limitations and enhance the detection of generated images, we propose a novel representation, Diffusion Noise Feature (DNF). Derived from the inverse process of diffusion models, DNF effectively amplifies the subtle, high-frequency artifacts that act as fingerprints of artificial generation. Our key insight is that real and generated images exhibit distinct DNF signatures, providing a robust basis for differentiation. By training a simple classifier such as ResNet-50 on DNF, our approach achieves remarkable accuracy, robustness, and generalization in detecting generated images, including those from unseen generators or with novel content. Extensive experiments across four training datasets and five test sets confirm that DNF establishes a new state-of-the-art in generated image detection.
