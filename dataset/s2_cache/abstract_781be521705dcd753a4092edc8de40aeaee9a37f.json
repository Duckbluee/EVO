{"abstract":"Medical conversations from patient visits are routinely summarized into clinical notes for documentation of clinical care. The automatic creation of clinical note is particularly challenging given that it requires summarization over spoken language and multiple speaker turns; as well, clinical notes include highly technical semi-structured text. In this paper, we describe our corpus creation method and baseline systems for two NLP tasks, clinical dialogue2note sentence alignment and clinical dialogue2note snippet summarization. These two systems, as well as other models created from such a corpus, may be incorporated as parts of an overall end-to-end clinical note generation system."}
