{"abstract":"Logs are one of the most valuable data sources for large-scale service (e.g., social network, search engine) maintenance. Log parsing serves as the the first step towards automated log analysis. However, the current log parsing methods are not adaptive. Without intra-service adaptiveness, log parsing cannot handle software/firmware upgrade because learned templates cannot match new type of logs. In addition, without cross-service adaptiveness, the logs of a new type of service cannot be accurately parsed when this service is newly deployed. We propose LogParse, an adaptive log parsing framework, to support intra-service and cross-service incremental template learning and update. LogParse turns the template generation problem into a word classification problem and learns the features of template words and variable words. We evaluate LogParse on four public production log datasets. The results demonstrate that LogParse supports accurate adaptive template update (increased from 0.559 to nearly 1.0 parsing accuracy), and a trained LogParse is adaptive for a brand new service’s log parsing. Because of LogParse’s adaptiveness, we also apply LogParse to an interesting application, log compression and deployed log compression in a top cloud service provider. We package LogParse into an open-source toolkit."}
