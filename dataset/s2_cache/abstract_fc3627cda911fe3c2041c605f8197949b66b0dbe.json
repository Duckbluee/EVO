{"abstract":"Treating each training sample unequally is prevalent in many machine-learning tasks. Numerous weighting schemes have been proposed. Some schemes take the easy-first mode, whereas others take the hard-first one. Naturally, an interesting yet realistic question is raised. Given a new learning task, which samples should be learned first, easy or hard? To answer this question, both theoretical analysis and experimental verification are conducted. First, a general objective function is proposed and the optimal weight can be derived from it, which reveals the relationship between the difficulty distribution of the training set and the priority mode. Two novel findings are subsequently obtained: besides the easy-first and hard-first modes, there are two other typical modes, namely, medium-first and two-ends-first; the priority mode may be varied if the difficulty distribution of the training set changes greatly. Second, inspired by the findings, a flexible weighting scheme (FlexW) is proposed for selecting the optimal priority mode when there is no prior knowledge or theoretical clues. The four priority modes can be flexibly switched in the proposed solution, thus suitable for various scenarios. Third, a wide range of experiments is conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed FlexW and further compare the weighting schemes in different modes under various learning scenarios. On the basis of these works, reasonable and comprehensive answers are obtained for the easy-or-hard question."}
