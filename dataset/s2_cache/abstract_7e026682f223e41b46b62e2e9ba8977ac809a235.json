{"abstract":"Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses, and the symptoms shown by patients are different, making it difficult to diagnose in the process of clinical practice and pathological research. Although researchers hope that artificial intelligence can contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of depression, the traditional centralized machine learning methods need to aggregate patient data, and the data privacy of patients with mental illness needs to be strictly confidential, which hinders machine learning algorithms’ clinical application. To solve the problem of medical data privacy with depression, in this article, we implement a study of federated learning to analyze and diagnose depression. First, we propose a general multiview federated learning framework using multisource data, which can extend any traditional machine learning model to support federated learning across different institutions or parties. Second, we employ later fusion methods to solve the problem of inconsistent time series of multiview data. Finally, we compare the federated framework with other cooperative learning frameworks in performance and discuss the related results. The experimental results show that in the case of participating in federated learning with enough participants, the prediction accuracy of depression score can reach 85.13%, which is about 15% higher than local training. When the number of participants is small and the amount of data is sufficient, the prediction accuracy of depression score can also reach 84.32%, and the improvement rate is about 9%."}
