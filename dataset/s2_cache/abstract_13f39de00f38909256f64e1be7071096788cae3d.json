{"abstract":"Deep graph clustering, which aims to reveal the underlying graph structure and divide the nodes into different clusters without human annotations, is a fundamental yet challenging task. However, we observed that the existing methods suffer from the representation collapse problem and easily tend to encode samples with different classes into the same latent embedding. Consequently, the discriminative capability of nodes is limited, resulting in sub-optimal clustering performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel deep graph clustering algorithm termed Improved Dual Correlation Reduction Network (IDCRN) through improving the discriminative capability of samples. Specifically, by approximating the cross-view feature correlation matrix to an identity matrix, we reduce the redundancy between different dimensions of features, thus improving the discriminative capability of the latent space explicitly. Meanwhile, the cross-view sample correlation matrix is forced to approximate the designed clustering-refined adjacency matrix to guide the learned latent representation to recover the affinity matrix even across views, thus enhancing the discriminative capability of features implicitly. Moreover, we avoid the collapsed representation caused by the over-smoothing issue in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) through an introduced propagation regularization term, enabling IDCRN to capture the long-range information with the shallow network structure. Extensive experimental results on six benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness and the efficiency of IDCRN compared to the existing state-of-the-art deep graph clustering algorithms."}
