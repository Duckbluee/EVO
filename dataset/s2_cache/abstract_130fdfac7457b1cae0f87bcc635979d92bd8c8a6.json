{"abstract":"Open set recognition (OSR) aims to correctly recognize the known classes and reject the unknown classes for increasing the reliability of the recognition system. The distance-based loss is often employed in deep neural networks-based OSR methods to constrain the latent representation of known classes. However, the optimization is usually conducted using the nondirectional euclidean distance in a single feature space without considering the potential impact of spatial distribution. To address this problem, we propose orientational distribution learning (ODL) with hierarchical spatial attention for OSR. In ODL, the spatial distribution of feature representation is optimized orientationally to increase the discriminability of decision boundaries for open set recognition. Then, a hierarchical spatial attention mechanism is proposed to assist ODL to capture the global distribution dependencies in the feature space based on spatial relationships. Moreover, a composite feature space is constructed to integrate the features from different layers and different mapping approaches, and it can well enrich the representation information. Finally, a decision-level fusion method is developed to combine the composite feature space and the naive feature space for producing a more comprehensive classification result. The effectiveness of ODL has been demonstrated on various benchmark datasets, and ODL achieves state-of-the-art performance."}
