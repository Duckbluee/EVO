{"abstract":"As a new machine learning (ML) paradigm, federated learning (FL) empowers different participants to jointly train a more effective model than traditional ML. Unlike horizontal FL (HFL), which expands the sample space by aggregating local models, vertical FL (VFL) is suitable for scenarios where the sample ID between participants is the same but differs in sample characteristics. For a long time, VFL has been considered safe due to no data exchange and heterogeneity between parties. However, the recently proposed label inference attacks pose a significant security threat to VFL. Specifically, by adding randomly initialized layers to the top of local models, the passive label inference attack can infer tens of thousands of local participants’ private data with only 40 auxiliary labels. Since the attack is entirely local, using privacy protection technologies such as differential privacy cannot effectively defend against these attacks. Therefore, we propose a new privacy protection scheme called FL similar gradients (FLSGs) to defend against this attack. Unlike differential privacy, the FLSG scheme randomly generates gradients of a Gaussian distribution similar in dimension to the original gradients and calculates their cosine distance. If the distance is less than a certain threshold, the gradients are used instead of the original gradients to pass to the local participants. We conducted extensive evaluations on six real-world data sets, and the results show that FLSG provides a better defensive effect at lower computational overhead than other known methods when defending the passive label inference attack."}
