This survey thus provides a comprehensive review of the research progress and evolution in text summarization through the lens of these paradigm shifts. It is organized into two main parts: (1) a detailed overview of datasets, evaluation metrics, and summarization methods before the LLM era, encompassing traditional statistical methods, deep learning approaches, and PLM fine-tuning techniques, and (2) the first detailed examination of recent advancements in benchmarking, modeling, and evaluating summarization in the LLM era. By synthesizing existing literature and presenting a cohesive overview, this survey also discusses research trends, open challenges, and proposes promising research directions in summarization, aiming to guide researchers through the evolving landscape of summarization research."}
