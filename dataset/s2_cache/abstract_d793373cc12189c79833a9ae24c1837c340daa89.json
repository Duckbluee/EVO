{"abstract":"Despite AI transforming algorithmic trading, the lack of transparency in these systems, sometimes referred to as “black boxes,” hinders wider confidence and acceptance. This proposed research presents a novel approach to uncovering the decision-making process of AI-driven trading strategies. It utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to produce visual explanations that are easy to understand. This methodology surpasses conventional methods of explain ability by transforming the intricate, data-derived understandings of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement-learning agent into easily understandable visual representations. More precisely, we utilize saliency maps to emphasize the crucial market elements that affect the agent's actions, offering an unparalleled level of understanding of its operational reasoning. Our assessment highlights the effectiveness of these visualizations in improving human comprehension, thus closing the gap between advanced AI capabilities and practical financial experience. This work not only promotes increased clarity and trust in algorithmic trading but also establishes a standard for using visual explanations in intricate AI systems. This has ramifications for adhering to regulations, creating algorithms, and involving stakeholders in the financial sector."}
