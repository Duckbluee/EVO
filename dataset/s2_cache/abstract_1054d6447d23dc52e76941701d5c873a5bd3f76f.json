{"abstract":"Class evolution, the phenomenon of class emergence and disappearance, is an important research topic for data stream mining. All previous studies implicitly regard class evolution as a transient change, which is not true for many real-world problems. This paper concerns the scenario where classes emerge or disappear gradually. A class-based ensemble approach, namely Class-Based ensemble for Class Evolution (CBCE), is proposed. By maintaining a base learner for each class and dynamically updating the base learners with new data, CBCE can rapidly adjust to class evolution. A novel under-sampling method for the base learners is also proposed to handle the dynamic class-imbalance problem caused by the gradual evolution of classes. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of CBCE in various class evolution scenarios in comparison to existing class evolution adaptation methods."}
