{"abstract":"During the past decade, deep learning is one of the essential breakthroughs made in artificial intelligence. In particular, it has achieved great success in image processing. Correspondingly, various applications related to image processing are also promoting the rapid development of deep learning in all aspects of network structure, layer designing, and training tricks. However, the deeper structure makes the back-propagation algorithm more difficult. At the same time, the scale of training images without labels is also rapidly increasing, and class imbalance severely affects the performance of deep learning, these urgently require more novelty deep models and new parallel computing system to more effectively interpret the content of the image and form a suitable analysis mechanism. In this context, this survey provides four deep learning model series, which includes CNN series, GAN series, ELM-RVFL series, and other series, for comprehensive understanding towards the analytical techniques of image processing field, clarify the most important advancements and shed some light on future studies. By further studying the relationship between deep learning and image processing tasks, which can not only help us understand the reasons for the success of deep learning but also inspires new deep models and training methods. More importantly, this survey aims to improve or arouse other researchers to catch a glimpse of the state-of-the-art deep learning methods in the field of image processing and facilitate the applications of these deep learning technologies in their research tasks. Besides, we discuss the open issues and the promising directions of future research in image processing using the new generation of deep learning."}
