{"abstract":"In numerous network analysis tasks, feature representation plays an imperative role. Due to the intrinsic nature of networks being discrete, enormous challenges are imposed on their effective usage. There has been a significant amount of attention on network feature learning in recent times that has the potential of mapping discrete features into a continuous feature space. The methods, however, lack preserving the structural information owing to the utilization of random negative sampling during the training phase. The ability to effectively join attribute information to embedding feature space is also compromised. To address the shortcomings identified, a novel attribute force-based graph (AGForce) learning model is proposed that keeps the structural information intact along with adaptively joining attribute information to the node’s features. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets are performed. AGForce based on the spring-electrical model extends opportunities to simulate node interaction for graph learning."}
