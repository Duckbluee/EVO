{"abstract":"Recent releases of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained considerable traction, yet research on fine-tuning and employing domain-specific LLMs remains scarce. This study investigates approaches for fine-tuning and leveraging domain-specific LLMs, highlighting trends in LLMs, foundational models, and methods for domain-specific pre-training. Focusing on the financial sector, it details dataset selection, preprocessing, model choice, and considerations crucial for LLM fine-tuning in finance. Addressing the unique characteristics of financial data, the study explores the construction of domain-specific vocabularies and considerations for security and regulatory compliance. In the practical application of LLM fine-tuning, the study outlines the procedure and implementation for generating domain-specific LLMs in finance. Various financial cases, including stock price prediction, sentiment analysis of financial news, automated document processing, research, information extraction, and customer service enhancement, are exemplified. The study explores the potential of LLMs in the financial domain, identifies limitations, and proposes directions for improvement, contributing valuable insights for future research. Ultimately, it advances natural language processing technology in business, suggesting proactive LLM utilization in financial services across industries."}
