{"abstract":"The size and complexity of deep neural networks used in AI applications continue to grow exponentially, significantly increasing energy consumption for training and inference by these models. We introduce an open-source package eco2AI to help data scientists and researchers to track the energy consumption and equivalent CO2 emissions of their models in a straightforward way. In eco2AI we focus on accurate tracking of energy consumption and regional CO2 emissions accounting. We encourage the research for community to search for new optimal Artificial Intelligence (AI) architectures with lower computational cost. The motivation also comes from the concept of AI-based greenhouse gases sequestrating cycle with both Sustainable AI and Green AI pathways.
