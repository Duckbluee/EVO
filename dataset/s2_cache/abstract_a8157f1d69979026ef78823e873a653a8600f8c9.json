{"abstract":"Recently, the performance advancement of discriminative correlation filter (DCF) based trackers is predominantly driven by the use of deep convolutional features. As convolutional features from multiple layers capture different target information, existing works integrate hierarchical convolutional features to enhance target representation. However, these works separate feature integration from DCF learning and hardly benefit from end-to-end training. In this letter, we incorporates feature integration and DCF learning in a unified convolutional neural network. This network reformulates feature integration as a differential module that concatenates features from the shallow and deep layers. A channel attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively impose channel-wise weight on the integrated features. Experimental results on OTB100 and UAV123 demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvement while running in real-time."}
