{"abstract":"Recent studies have shifted their focus towards formulating traffic forecasting as a spatio-temporal graph modeling problem. Typically, they constructed a static spatial graph at each time step and then connected each node with itself between adjacent time steps to create a spatio-temporal graph. However, this approach failed to explicitly reflect the correlations between different nodes at different time steps, thus limiting the learning capability of graph neural networks. Additionally, those models overlooked the dynamic spatio-temporal correlations among nodes by using the same adjacency matrix across different time steps. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach called Spatio-Temporal Joint Graph Convolutional Networks (STJGCN) for accurate traffic forecasting on road networks over multiple future time steps. Specifically, our method encompasses the construction of both pre-defined and adaptive spatio-temporal joint graphs (STJGs) between any two time steps, which represent comprehensive and dynamic spatio-temporal correlations. We further introduce dilated causal spatio-temporal joint graph convolution layers on the STJG to capture spatio-temporal dependencies from distinct perspectives with multiple ranges. To aggregate information from different ranges, we propose a multi-range attention mechanism. Finally, we evaluate our approach on five public traffic datasets and experimental results demonstrate that STJGCN is not only computationally efficient but also outperforms 11 state-of-the-art baseline methods."}
