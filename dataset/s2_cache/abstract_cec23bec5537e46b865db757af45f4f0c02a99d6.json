{"abstract":"The safety-critical scenarios of artificial intelligence (AI), such as autonomous driving, Internet of Things, smart healthcare, etc., have raised critical requirements of trustworthy AI to guarantee the privacy and security with reliable decisions. As a nascent branch for trustworthy AI, federated learning (FL) has been regarded as a promising privacy preserving framework for training a global AI model over collaborative devices. However, security challenges still exist in the FL framework, e.g., Byzantine attacks from malicious devices, and model tampering attacks from malicious server, which will degrade or destroy the accuracy of trained global AI model. In this article, we shall propose a decentralized blockchain-based FL (B-FL) architecture by using a secure global aggregation algorithm to resist malicious devices, and deploying a practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol with high effectiveness and low energy consumption among multiple edge servers to prevent model tampering from the malicious server. However, to implement B-FL system at the network edge, multiple rounds of cross-validation in blockchain consensus protocol will induce long training latency. We thus formulate a network optimization problem that jointly considers bandwidth and power allocation for the minimization of long-term average training latency consisting of progressive learning rounds. We further propose to transform the network optimization problem as a Markov decision process and leverage the deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm to provide high system performance with low computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that B-FL can resist malicious attacks from edge devices and servers, and the training latency of B-FL can be significantly reduced by the DRL-based algorithm compared with the baseline algorithms."}
