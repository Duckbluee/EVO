{"abstract":"Abusive language is an important issue in online communication across different platforms and languages. Having a robust model to detect abusive instances automatically is a prominent challenge. Several studies have been proposed to deal with this vital issue by modeling this task in the cross-domain and cross-lingual setting. This paper outlines and describes the current state of this research direction, providing an overview of previous studies, including the available datasets and approaches employed in both cross-domain and cross-lingual settings. This study also outlines several challenges and open problems of this area, providing insights and a useful roadmap for future work."}
