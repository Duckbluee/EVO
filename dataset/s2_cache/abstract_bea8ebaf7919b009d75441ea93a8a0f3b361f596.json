{"abstract":"Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), a model-agnostic meta-learning method, is successfully employed in NLP applications including few-shot text classification and multi-domain low-resource language generation. Many impacting factors, including data quantity, similarity among tasks, and the balance between general language model and task-specific adaptation, can affect the performance of MAML in NLP, but few works have thoroughly studied them. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to investigate these impacting factors and conclude when MAML works the best based on the experimental results."}
