{"abstract":"Because of their contribution to the overall reliability assurance process, software logs have become important data assets for the analysis of software systems. Logs are often the only data points that can shed light on how a software system behaves once deployed. Unfortunately, logs are often unstructured data items, hindering viable analysis of their content. There are studies that aim to automatically parse large log files. The primary goal is to create templates from raw log data samples that can later be used to recognize future logs. In this paper, we propose ULP, a Unified Log Parsing tool, which is highly accurate and efficient. ULP combines string matching and local frequency analysis to parse large log files in an efficient manner. First, log events are organized into groups using a text processing method. Frequency analysis is then applied locally to instances of the same group to identify static and dynamic content of log events. When applied to 10 log datasets of the LogPai benchmark, ULP achieves an average accuracy of 89.2%, which outperforms the accuracy of four leading log parsing tools, namely Drain, Logram, SPELL and AEL. Additionally, ULP can parse up to four million log events in less than 3 minutes. ULP is available online as an open source and can be readily used by practitioners and researchers to parse effectively and efficiently large log files so as to support log analysis tasks."}
