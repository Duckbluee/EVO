{"abstract":"Recent advancements with deep generative models have proven significant potential in the task of image synthesis, detection, segmentation, and classification. Segmenting the medical images is considered a primary challenge in the biomedical imaging field. There have been various GANs-based models proposed in the literature to resolve medical segmentation challenges. Our research outcome has identified 151 papers; after the twofold screening, 138 papers are selected for the final survey. A comprehensive survey is conducted on GANs network application to medical image segmentation, primarily focused on various GANs-based models, performance metrics, loss function, datasets, augmentation methods, paper implementation, and source codes. Secondly, this paper provides a detailed overview of GANs network application in different human diseases segmentation. We conclude our research with critical discussion, limitations of GANs, and suggestions for future directions. We hope this survey is beneficial and increases awareness of GANs network implementations for biomedical image segmentation tasks."}
