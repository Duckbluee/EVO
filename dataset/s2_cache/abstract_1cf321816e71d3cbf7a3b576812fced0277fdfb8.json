{"abstract":"The imputeTS package specializes on univariate time series imputation. It offers multiple state-of-the-art imputation algorithm implementations along with plotting functions for time series missing data statistics. While imputation in general is a well-known problem and widely covered by R packages, ﬁnding packages able to ﬁll missing values in univariate time series is more complicated. The reason for this lies in the fact, that most imputation algorithms rely on inter-attribute correlations, while univariate time series imputation instead needs to employ time dependencies. This paper provides an introduction to the imputeTS package and its provided algorithms and tools. Furthermore, it gives a short overview about univariate time series imputation in R. that provides a collection of and tools this task. Using example time series, we illustrated the ease of use and the advantages of the provided functions. Simple algorithms as well as more complicated ones can be applied in the same simple and user-friendly manner."}
