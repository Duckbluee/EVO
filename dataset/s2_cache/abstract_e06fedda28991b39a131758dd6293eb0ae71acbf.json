{"abstract":"Although Federated Learning allows for participants to contribute their local data without it being revealed, it faces issues in data security and in accurately paying participants for quality data contributions. In this paper, we propose an EOS Blockchain design and workflow to establish data security, a novel validation error based metric upon which we qualify gradient uploads for payment, and implement a small example of our blockchain Federated Learning model to analyze its performance."}
