{"abstract":"Leveraging Large Language Models as recommenders, referred to as LLMRec, is gaining traction and brings novel dynamics for modeling user preferences, particularly for cold-start users. However, existing LLMRec approaches primarily focus on text semantics and overlook the crucial aspect of incorporating collaborative information from user-item interactions, leading to potentially sub-optimal performance in warm-start scenarios. To ensure superior recommendations across both warm and cold scenarios, we introduce CoLLM, an innovative LLMRec approach that explicitly integrates collaborative information for recommendations. CoLLM treats collaborative information as a distinct modality, directly encoding it from well-established traditional collaborative models, and then tunes a mapping module to align this collaborative information with the LLM's input text token space for recommendations. By externally integrating traditional models, CoLLM ensures effective collaborative information modeling without modifying the LLM itself, providing the flexibility to adopt diverse collaborative information modeling mechanisms. Extensive experimentation validates that CoLLM adeptly integrates collaborative information into LLMs, resulting in enhanced recommendation performance."}
