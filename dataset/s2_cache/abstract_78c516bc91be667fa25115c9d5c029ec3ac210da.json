{"abstract":"Substantial research works have shown that deep models, e.g., pre-trained models, on the large corpus can learn universal language representations, which are beneficial for downstream NLP tasks. However, these powerful models are also vulnerable to various privacy attacks, while much sensitive information exists in the training dataset. The attacker can easily steal sensitive information from public models, e.g., individuals' email addresses and phone numbers. In an attempt to address these issues, particularly the unauthorized use of private data, we introduce a novel watermarking technique via a backdoor-based membership inference approach named TextMarker, which can safeguard diverse forms of private information embedded in the training text data. Specifically, TextMarker only requires data owners to mark a small number of samples for data copyright protection under the black-box access assumption to the target model. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TextMarker on various real-world datasets, e.g., marking only 0.1% of the training dataset is practically sufficient for effective membership inference with negligible effect on model utility. We also discuss potential countermeasures and show that TextMarker is stealthy enough to bypass them."}
