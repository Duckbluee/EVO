{"abstract":"With the increasing demand for differentiated virtual environments, the need for dynamic content generation arises, speeding up development, reducing productions costs, and increasing the product shelf life. In general, procedurally generated world offer a greater range of details in the environment and experience customization without sacrificing performance, but this is only guaranteed when the content obtained satisfies the user in quality and diversity. Thus, the use of algorithms that are able to guarantee the quality of the generated experience without lacking diversity is required. This paper presents a technique that can be used to develop virtual environments both in its production, providing the developer with different design possibilities to be developed and refined, as well as execution, building unique simulations while interfacing with the user. Therefore, the technique developed makes use of morphological niches to ensure diversity of solutions, producing results that provide the best solutions within each group, surpassing in quality of the existing techniques, such as novelty search and local competition."}
