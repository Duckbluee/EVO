{"abstract":"We present a randomized algorithm that on input a symmetric, weakly diagonally dominant $n$-by-$n$ matrix $A$ with $m$ nonzero entries and an $n$-vector $b$ produces an ${\\tilde{x}} $ such that $\\|{\\tilde{x}} - A^{\\dagger} {b} \\|_{A} \\leq \\epsilon \\|A^{\\dagger} {b}\\|_{A}$ in expected time $O (m \\log^{c}n \\log (1/\\epsilon))$ for some constant $c$. By applying this algorithm inside the inverse power method, we compute approximate Fiedler vectors in a similar amount of time. The algorithm applies subgraph preconditioners in a recursive fashion. These preconditioners improve upon the subgraph preconditioners first introduced by Vaidya in 1990. For any symmetric, weakly diagonally dominant matrix $A$ with nonpositive off-diagonal entries and $k \\geq 1$, we construct in time $O (m \\log^{c} n)$ a preconditioner $B$ of $A$ with at most $2 (n - 1) + O ((m/k) \\log^{39} n)$ nonzero off-diagonal entries such that the finite generalized condition number $\\kappa_{f} (A,B)$ is at most $k$, for some other constant $c$.
