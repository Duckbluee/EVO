{"abstract":"Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial task in recommender systems and online advertising. The embedding-based neural networks have been proposed to learn both explicit feature interactions through a shallow component and deep feature interactions by a deep neural network (DNN) component. These sophisticated models, however, slow down the prediction inference by at least hundreds of times. To address the issue of significantly increased serving latency and high memory usage for real-time serving in production, this paper presents DeepLight: a framework to accelerate the CTR predictions in three aspects: 1) accelerate the model inference via explicitly searching informative feature interactions in the shallow component; 2) prune redundant parameters at the inter-layer level in the DNN component; 3) prune the dense embedding vectors to make them sparse in the embedding matrix. By combining the above efforts, the proposed approach accelerates the model inference by 46X on Criteo dataset and 27X on Avazu dataset without any loss on the prediction accuracy. This paves the way for successfully deploying complicated embedding-based neural networks in real-world serving systems."}
