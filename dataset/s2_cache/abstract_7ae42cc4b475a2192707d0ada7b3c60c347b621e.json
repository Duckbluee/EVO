{"abstract":"We present two algorithms for the approximate nearest neighbor problem in high dimensional spaces. For data sets of size n living in IR d , the algorithms require space that is only polynomial in n and d , while achieving query times that are sub-linear in n and polynomial in d . We also show applications to other high-dimensional geometric problems, such as the approximate minimum spanning tree."}
