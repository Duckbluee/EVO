{"abstract":"Recent advancements in open vocabulary models, like CLIP, have notably advanced zero-shot classification and segmentation by utilizing natural language for class-specific embeddings. However, most research has focused on improving model accuracy through prompt engineering, prompt learning, or fine-tuning with limited labeled data, thereby overlooking the importance of refining the class descriptors. This paper introduces a new approach to text-supervised semantic segmentation using supervision by a large language model (LLM) that does not require extra training. Our method starts from an LLM, like GPT-3, to generate a detailed set of subclasses for more accurate class representation. We then employ an advanced text-supervised semantic segmentation model to apply the generated subclasses as target labels, resulting in diverse segmentation results tailored to each subclass's unique characteristics. Additionally, we propose an assembly that merges the segmentation maps from the various subclass descriptors to ensure a more comprehensive representation of the different aspects in the test images. Through comprehensive experiments on three standard benchmarks, our method outperforms traditional text-supervised semantic segmentation methods by a marked margin."}
