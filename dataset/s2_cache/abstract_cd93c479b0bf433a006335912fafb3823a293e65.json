{"abstract":"Implicit authentication has become increasingly popular over recent years due to the fact that it relieves users from explicit actions such as remembering and entering passwords. This paper puts forward ICAuth, a general and simple implicit authentication method for mobile devices, to authenticate the current user implicitly and continuously when the screen is awake. Distinct from existing implicit user authentication methods which only focus on behavioral characteristics and ignore contextual information, ICAuth is devised to understand different behaviors in various contexts. We investigate the correlations between the behavioral characteristics and contextual information via sensors on mobile devices and observe that user's behavioral characteristics are strongly related to the context. These sensors are divided into two kinds, including fine-grained sensors and coarse-grained sensors, where fine-grained sensor data represent behavioral features and the coarse-grained depict contextual information. ICAuth provides continuous authentication without the involvement of users. It promotes security via authenticating the current user continuously and improves the usability via eliminating the limitation of specific behaviors. We evaluate ICAuth comprehensively with a large dataset including 340842 samples collected from 142 subjects. Our approach achieves an accuracy of 96.85%, FNR of 2.95%, and FPR of 4.01%. Security analysis is also conducted to demonstrate that ICAuth is resilient against common smartphone authentication threats. Finally, we show the low power consumption and authentication latency with 2.2 seconds of ICAuth."}
