{"abstract":"This article systematically studies consensus of linear multiagent systems (MASs) on directed graphs through adaptive event-triggered control. It presents innovative adaptive event-triggered state-feedback protocols with novel composite event-triggering conditions. Two specific designs in terms of different event-triggering conditions and laws of adaption are first discussed for linear MASs on strongly connected directed graphs, which are then extended to general directed graphs that contain a spanning tree. Moreover, another adaptive event-triggered protocol is proposed for solving leader–follower consensus that tracks a leader of a bounded control input. The protocols inherit the merits of both adaptive control and event-triggered control: the protocols can be implemented in a fully distributed way, since the Laplacian is avoided in design, and each agent only needs to know the relative information between neighbors at discrete instants determined by event-triggering conditions. Compared with the existing related results, the proposed protocols are applicable for linear MASs on general directed graphs, and moreover, the time-dependent term in the event-triggering conditions is allowed to be a class of positive $L_1$ functions. Two numerical examples clearly verify the effectiveness of the proposed protocols."}
