{"abstract":"This paper presents a bi-view (front and side) audiovisual Lombard speech corpus, which is freely available for download. It contains 5400 utterances (2700 Lombard and 2700 plain reference utterances), produced by 54 talkers, with each utterance in the dataset following the same sentence format as the audiovisual \"Grid\" corpus [Cooke, Barker, Cunningham, and Shao (2006). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 120(5), 2421-2424]. Analysis of this dataset confirms previous research, showing prominent acoustic, phonetic, and articulatory speech modifications in Lombard speech. In addition, gender differences are observed in the size of Lombard effect. Specifically, female talkers exhibit a greater increase in estimated vowel duration and a greater reduction in F2 frequency."}
