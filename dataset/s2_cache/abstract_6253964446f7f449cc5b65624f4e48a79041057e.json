{"abstract":"The synthetic data approach to data confidentiality has been actively researched on, and for the past decade or so, a good number of high quality work on developing innovative synthesizers, creating appropriate utility measures and risk measures, among others, have been published. Comparing to a large volume of work on synthesizers development and utility measures creation, measuring risks has overall received less attention. This paper focuses on the detailed re-construction of some Bayesian methods proposed for estimating disclosure risks in synthetic data. In the processes of presenting attribute and identification disclosure risks evaluation methods, we highlight key steps, emphasize Bayesian thinking, illustrate with real application examples, and discuss challenges and future research directions. We hope to give the readers a comprehensive view of the Bayesian estimation procedures, enable synthetic data researchers and producers to use these procedures to evaluate disclosure risks, and encourage more researchers to work in this important growing field."}
