{"abstract":"Data privacy and security are incredibly important in the healthcare industry. Federated learning is a new way of training a machine learning algorithm using distributed data which is not hosted in a centralized server. Numerous centralized machine learning models exists in literature but none offers privacy to users’ data. This paper proposes a federated learning approach for early detection of Type-2 Diabetes among patients. A simple federated architecture is exploited for early detection of Type-2 diabetes. We compare the proposed federated learning model against our centralised approach. Experimental results prove that the federated learning model ensures significant privacy over centralised learning model whereas compromising accuracy for a subtle extend."}
