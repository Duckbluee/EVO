{"abstract":"This article surveys manipulation, including both biological and robotic manipulation. Biology inspires robotics and demonstrates aspects of manipulation that are far in the future of robotics. Robotics develops concepts and principles that become evident only in the creative process. Robotics also provides a test of our understanding. As Richard Feynman put it: “What I cannot create, I do not understand.”"}
