{"abstract":"Bearings are very important components in mechanical equipment, and detecting bearing failures helps ensure healthy operation of mechanical equipment and can prevent catastrophic accidents. Most of the well-established detection methods do not take into account the correlation between signals and are difficult to accurately identify those fault samples that have a low degree of failure. To address this problem, we propose a graph neural network-based bearing fault detection (GNNBFD) method. The method first constructs a graph using the similarity between samples; secondly the constructed graph is fed into a graph neural network (GNN) for feature mapping, and the samples outputted by the GNN network fuse the feature information of their neighbors, which is beneficial to the downstream detection task; then the samples mapped by the GNN network are fed into base detector for fault detection; finally, the results determined by the integrated base detector algorithm are determined, and the top n samples with the highest outlier scores are the faulty samples. The experimental results with five state-of-the-art algorithms on publicly available datasets show that the GNNBFD algorithm improves the AUC by 6.4% compared to the next best algorithm, proving that the GNNBFD algorithm is effective and feasible."}
