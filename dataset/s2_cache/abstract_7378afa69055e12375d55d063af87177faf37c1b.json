{"abstract":"Neural implicit representations have recently become popular in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), especially in dense visual SLAM. However, existing works either rely on RGB-D sensors or require a separate monocular SLAM approach for camera tracking, and fail to produce high-fidelity 3D dense reconstructions. To address these shortcomings, we present NICER-SLAM, a dense RGB SLAM system that simultaneously optimizes for camera poses and a hierarchical neural implicit map representation, which also allows for high-quality novel view synthesis. To facilitate the optimization process for mapping, we integrate additional supervision signals including easy-to-obtain monocular geometric cues and optical flow, and also introduce a simple warping loss to further enforce geometric consistency. Moreover, to further boost performance in complex large-scale scenes, we also propose a local adaptive transformation from signed distance functions (SDFs) to density in the volume rendering equation. On multiple challenging indoor and outdoor datasets, NICER-SLAM demonstrates strong performance in dense mapping, novel view synthesis, and tracking, even competitive with recent RGB-D SLAM systems.
