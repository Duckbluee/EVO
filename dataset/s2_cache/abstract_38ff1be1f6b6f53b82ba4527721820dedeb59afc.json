{"abstract":"Abstract The model parameters of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are determined by backpropagation (BP). In this work, we propose an interpretable feedforward (FF) design without any BP. The FF design adopts a data-centric approach. It derives network parameters of the current layer based on data statistics from the output of the previous layer in a one-pass manner. To construct convolutional layers, we develop a new signal transform, called the Saab (Subspace approximation with adjusted bias) transform. It is a variant of the principal component analysis with an added bias vector to annihilate activation’s nonlinearity. Multiple Saab transforms in cascade yield multiple convolutional layers. As to fully-connected layers, we construct them using a cascade of multi-stage linear least squared regressors. The classification and robustness performances of BP- and FF-designed CNNs applied to the MNIST and the CIFAR-10 datasets are compared. Finally, we comment on the relationship between BP and FF designs."}
