{"abstract":"With the prevalence of online social platforms, social recommendation has emerged as a promising direction that leverages the social network among users to enhance recommendation performance. However, the available social relations among users are usually extremely sparse and noisy, which may lead to inferior recommendation performance. To alleviate this problem, this paper novelly exploits the implicit higher-order social influence and dependencies among users to enhance social recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding method for general bipartite graphs, which defines inter-class message passing between explicit relations and intra-class message passing between implicit higher-order relations via a novel sequential modelling paradigm. Inspired by recent advances in self-attention-based sequential modelling, the proposed model features a self-attentive representation learning mechanism for implicit user-user relations. Moreover, this paper also explores the inductive embedding learning for social recommendation problems to improve the recommendation performance in cold-start settings. The proposed inductive learning paradigm for social recommendation enables embedding inference for those cold-start users and items (unseen during training) as long as they are linked to existing nodes in the original network. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method and suggest that higher-order implicit relationship among users is beneficial to improving social recommendation."}
