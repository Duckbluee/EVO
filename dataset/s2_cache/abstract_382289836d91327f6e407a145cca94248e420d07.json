{"abstract":"The picture owner's gender has a strong influence on individuals' emotional reactions to the picture. In this study, we investigate gender inference attacks on their owners from pictures meta-data composed of: (i) alt-texts generated by Facebook to describe the content of pictures, and (ii) Emojis/Emoticons posted by friends, friends of friends or regular users as a reaction to the picture. Specifically, we study the correlation of picture owner gender with alt-text, and Emojis/Emoticons used by commenters when reacting to these pictures. We leverage this image sharing and reaction mode of Facebook users to derive an efficient and accurate technique for user gender inference. We show that such a privacy attack often succeeds even when other information than pictures published by their owners is either hidden or unavailable."}
