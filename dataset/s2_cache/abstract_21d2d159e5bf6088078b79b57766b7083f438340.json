{"abstract":"Ethereum is the largest public blockchain by usage. It applies an account-based model, which is inferior to Bitcoin's unspent transaction output model from a privacy perspective. Due to its privacy shortcomings, recently, several privacy-enhancing overlays have been deployed on Ethereum, such as non-custodial, trustless coin mixers and confidential transactions. In our privacy analysis of Ethereum's account-based model, we describe several patterns that characterize only a limited set of users and successfully apply these “quasi-identifiers” in address deanonymization tasks. Using Ethereum Name Service identifiers as ground truth information, we quantitatively compare algorithms in a recent branch of machine learning, the so-called graph representation learning, as well as time-of-day activity and transaction fee based user profiling techniques. As an application, we rigorously assess the privacy guarantees of the Tornado Cash coin mixer by discovering patterns of careless usage to link the mixing parties. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose and implement Ethereum user profiling techniques based on quasi-identifiers."}
