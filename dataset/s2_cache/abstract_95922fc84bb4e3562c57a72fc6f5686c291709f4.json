{"abstract":"Vanishing gradients can pose substantial obstacles for high-dimensional optimization problems. Here we consider energy minimization problems for quantum many-body systems with extensive Hamiltonians and finite-range interactions, which can be studied on classical computers or in the form of variational quantum eigensolvers on quantum computers. Barren plateaus correspond to scenarios where the average amplitude of the energy gradient decreases exponentially with increasing system size. This occurs, for example, for quantum neural networks and for brickwall quantum circuits when the depth increases polynomially in the system size. Here we prove that the variational optimization problems for matrix product states, tree tensor networks, and the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz are free of barren plateaus. The derived scaling properties for the gradient variance provide an analytical guarantee for the trainability of randomly initialized tensor network states (TNS) and motivate certain initialization schemes. In a suitable representation, unitary tensors that parametrize the TNS are sampled according to the uniform Haar measure. We employ a Riemannian formulation of the gradient based optimizations which simplifies the analytical evaluation."}
