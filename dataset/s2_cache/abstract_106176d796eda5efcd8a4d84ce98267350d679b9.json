{"abstract":"Abstract Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that involves the design and implementation of systems and algorithms able to interact through human language. Thanks to the recent advances of deep learning, NLP applications have received an unprecedented boost in performance. In this paper, we present a survey of the application of deep learning techniques in NLP, with a focus on the various tasks where deep learning is demonstrating stronger impact. Additionally, we explore, describe, and revise the main resources in NLP research, including software, hardware, and popular corpora. Finally, we emphasize the main limits of deep learning in NLP and current research directions."}
