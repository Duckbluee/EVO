{"abstract":"Our laboratory reported that facial skin blood flow may serve as a sensitive tool to assess an emotional status and that both prefrontal oxygenation (as index of regional cerebral blood flow) and facial skin blood flow decrease during positively-charged emotional stimulation, without changing hand skin blood flow and arterial pressure. However, the focal location of the prefrontal responses in concentration of oxygenated haemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) that correlate with peripheral autonomic reaction remained unknown. This study was undertaken using 22-channel near-infrared spectroscopy to reveal spatial distribution of the responses in Oxy-Hb within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during emotionally-charged audiovisual stimulation. Pleasantly-charged (comedy) stimulation caused a substantial decrease of Oxy-Hb in all regions of the PFC in 18 subjects, especially in the rostroventral frontopolar PFC, whereas negatively-charged (horror) or neutral stimulation (landscape) exhibited a weaker decrease or insignificant change in the prefrontal Oxy-Hb. In the rostral parts of the dorsolateral and ventral frontopolar PFC, the oxygenation response during comedy stimulation exhibited the most significant positive correlation with the decrease in facial skin blood flow. Thus the rostral regions of the PFC play a role in recognition and regulation of positive emotion and may be linked with neurally-mediated vasoconstriction of facial skin blood vessels."}
