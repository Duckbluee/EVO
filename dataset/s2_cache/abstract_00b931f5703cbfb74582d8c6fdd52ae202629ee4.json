{"abstract":"Machine Learning (ML) aims at designing models that learn from previous experience, without being explicitly formulated. Applications of machine learning are inexhaustible, including recognizing patterns, predicting future trends and making decisions, and they are capable of handling sizable quantities of multi-dimensional data in the form of large vectors and tensors. To perform these operations on classical computers, however, requires vast time and computational resources. Unlike the classical computers that rely on computations using binary bits, Quantum Computers (QC) benefit from qubits which can hold combinations of 0 and 1 at the same time via superposition and entanglement. This makes QCs powerful at handling and post processing large tensors, making them a prime target for implementing ML algorithms. While several models used for ML on QCs are based on concepts from their classical computing counterparts, utilization of the QC’s potential has made them the superior of the two. This paper presents an overview of the current state of knowledge in application of ML on QC, and evaluates the speed up, and complexity advantages of using quantum machines."}
