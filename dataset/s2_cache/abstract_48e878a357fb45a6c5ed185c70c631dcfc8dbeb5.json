{"abstract":"Pose transfer aims to transfer a given person into a specified posture, has recently attracted considerable attention. A typical pose transfer framework usually employs representative datasets to train a discriminative model, which is often violated by out-of-distribution (OOD) instances. Recently, test-time adaption (TTA) offers a feasible solution for OOD data by using a pre-trained model that learns essential features with self-supervision. However, those methods implicitly make an assumption that all test distributions have a unified signal that can be learned directly. In open-world conditions, the pose transfer task raises various independent signals: OOD appearance and skeleton, which need to be extracted and distributed in speciality. To address this point, we develop a SEquential Test-time Adaption (SETA). In the test-time phrase, SETA extracts and distributes external appearance texture by augmenting OOD data for self-supervised training. To make non-Euclidean similarity among different postures explicit, SETA uses the image representations derived from a person re-identification (Re-ID) model for similarity computation. By addressing implicit posture representation in the test-time sequentially, SETA greatly improves the generalization performance of current pose transfer models. In our experiment, we first show that pose transfer can be applied to open-world applications, including Tiktok reenactment and celebrity motion synthesis."}
