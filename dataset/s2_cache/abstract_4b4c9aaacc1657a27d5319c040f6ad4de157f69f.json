{"abstract":"This paper proposes a better semi-supervised semantic segmentation network using an improved generative adversarial network. It is important for the discriminator on the pixel level to know whether it correctly distinguishes the predicted probability map. However, currently there is no correlation between the actual credibility and the confidence map generated by the pixel-level discriminator. We study this problem and a new network is proposed, which includes one generator and two discriminators. One of the discriminators can output more reliable confidence maps on the pixel level and the other is trained to generate the probability on the image level, which is used as the dynamic threshold in the semi-supervised module instead of being set manually. In addition, the trusted region shared by the two discriminators is used to provide the semi-supervised reference. Through experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, the proposed network brings better gains, proving the effectiveness of the network."}
