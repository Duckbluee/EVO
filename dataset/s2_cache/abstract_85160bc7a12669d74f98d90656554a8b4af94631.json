{"abstract":"Role-Based Encryption (RBE) is an emerging new technique that integrates role based access control (RBAC) model with encryption. RBE embeds RBAC access policies in encrypted data itself so that only users belonging to appropriate roles are able to decrypt and access the data. However, the existing RBE schemes have been focusing on the single-organization cloud storage system, where the stored data can be accessed by users of the same organization. This paper presents a novel RBE scheme with efficient user revocation for the multi-organization cloud storage system, where the data from multiple independent organizations are stored and can be accessed by the authorized users from any other organization. Additionally, an outsourced decryption mechanism is introduced which enables the users to delegate expensive cryptographic operations to the cloud, thereby reducing the overhead on the end-users. Security and performance analyses of the proposed scheme demonstrate that it is provably secure against Chosen Plaintext Attack and can be useful for practical applications due to its low computation overhead."}
