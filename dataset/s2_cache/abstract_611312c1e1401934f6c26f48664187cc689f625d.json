{"abstract":"In the past few years, there has been a significant rise in toxic and hateful content on various social media platforms. Recently Black Lives Matter movement came into the picture, causing an avalanche of user generated responses on the internet. In this paper, we have proposed a Black Lives Matter related tweet hate speech dataset TweetBLM. Our dataset comprises 9165 manually annotated tweets that target the Black Lives Matter movement. We annotated the tweets into two classes, i.e., HATE and NONHATE based on their content related to racism erupted from the movement for the black community. In this work, we also generated useful statistical insights on our dataset and performed a systematic analysis of various machine learning models such as Random Forest, CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, Fasttext, BERTbase, and BERTlarge for the classification task on our dataset. Through our work, we aim at contributing to the substantial efforts of the research community for the identification and mitigation of hate speech on the internet. The dataset is publicly available."}
