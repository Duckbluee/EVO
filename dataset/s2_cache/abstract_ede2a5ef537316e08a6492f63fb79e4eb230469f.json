{"abstract":"Networks are general tools for modeling numerous information with features and complex relations. Network Embedding aims to learn low-dimension representations for vertexes in the network with rich information including content information and structural information. In recent years, many models based on neural network have been proposed to map the network representations into embedding space whose dimension is much lower than that in original space. However, most of existing methods have the following limitations: 1) they are based on content of nodes in network, failing to measure the structure similarity of nodes; 2) they cannot do well in protecting the privacy of users including the original content information and the structural information. In this paper, we propose a similarity-based graph neural network model, SGNN, which captures the structure information of nodes precisely in node classification tasks. It also takes advantage of the thought of federated learning to hide the original information from different data sources to protect users’ privacy. We use deep graph neural network with convolutional layers and dense layers to classify the nodes based on their structures and features. The node classification experiment results on public data sets including Aminer coauthor network, Brazil and Europe flight networks indicate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models with a higher accuracy."}
