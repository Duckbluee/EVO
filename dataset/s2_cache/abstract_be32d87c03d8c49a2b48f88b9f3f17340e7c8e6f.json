{"abstract":"This work focuses on automatically analyzing a speaker's sentiment in online videos containing movie reviews. In addition to textual information, this approach considers adding audio features as typically used in speech-based emotion recognition as well as video features encoding valuable valence information conveyed by the speaker. Experimental results indicate that training on written movie reviews is a promising alternative to exclusively using (spoken) in-domain data for building a system that analyzes spoken movie review videos, and that language-independent audio-visual analysis can compete with linguistic analysis."}
