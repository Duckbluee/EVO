{"abstract":"Urban vehicle emission prediction can help the regulation of vehicle pollution and traffic control. However, it is hard to predict the spatiotemporal variation of vehicle emission because of the spatial interactions and temporal correlations between different road segments as well as the high nonlinearity and complexity of vehicle emission variation. The existing methods solve the problem by splitting the region into standard segments or grids based on conventional deep learning methods, without considering that urban vehicle emission varies by graph-structured traffic road network and depends on many complex external environment factors. To address these issues, a spatiotemporal graph convolution multifusion network (ST-MFGCN) is proposed to leverage the graph structural properties as the inherent connectivity of road network for urban vehicle emission prediction, which can capture the vehicle emission spatiotemporal variation patterns and learn the effects of complex environmental factors. The proposed model consists of three parts: 1) a spatiotemporal graph convolution module to capture spatiotemporal dependencies by merging closeness, period, and trend sequences with temporal convolution as well as graph convolution is introduced to model the spatial dependencies; 2) an external factor component to divide multisource external factors into global and individual external features; and 3) a general fusion component to merge the spatiotemporal patterns and the external features as well as fit the mutation of emission measurement data by multifusion strategy. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated on the practical monitoring data of vehicle emission data in Hefei, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model can predict regional vehicle emissions effectively."}
