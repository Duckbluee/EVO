{"abstract":"Transformers are state-of-the-art deep learning models that are composed of stacked attention and point-wise, fully connected layers designed for handling sequential data. Transformers are not only ubiquitous throughout Natural Language Processing (NLP), but, recently, they have inspired a new wave of Computer Vision (CV) applications research. In this work, a Vision Transformer (ViT) is applied to predict the state variables of 2-dimensional Ising model simulations. Our experiments show that ViT outperform state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) when using a small number of microstate images from the Ising model corresponding to various boundary conditions and temperatures. This work opens the possibility of applying ViT to other simulations, and raises interesting research directions on how attention maps can learn about the underlying physics governing different phenomena."}
