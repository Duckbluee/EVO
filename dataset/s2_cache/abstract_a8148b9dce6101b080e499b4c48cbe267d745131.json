{"abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as valuable tools for many natural language understanding tasks. In safety-critical applications such as healthcare, the utility of these models is governed by their ability to generate factually accurate and complete outputs. In this work, we present dialog-enabled resolving agents (DERA). DERA is a paradigm made possible by the increased conversational abilities of LLMs. It provides a simple, interpretable forum for models to communicate feedback and iteratively improve output. We frame our dialog as a discussion between two agent types – a Researcher, who processes information and identifies crucial problem components, and a Decider, who has the autonomy to integrate the Researcher’s information and makes judgments on the final output.We test DERA against three clinically-focused tasks, with GPT-4 serving as our LLM. DERA shows significant improvement over the base GPT-4 performance in both human expert preference evaluations and quantitative metrics for medical conversation summarization and care plan generation. In a new finding, we also show that GPT-4’s performance (70%) on an open-ended version of the MedQA question-answering (QA) dataset (Jin 2021; USMLE) is well above the passing level (60%), with DERA showing similar performance. We will release the open-ended MedQA dataset."}
