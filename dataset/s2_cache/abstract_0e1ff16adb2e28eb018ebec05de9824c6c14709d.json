{"abstract":"In recent years, the exponential increase in the demand of wireless data transmission rises the urgency for accurate spectrum sensing approaches to improve spectrum efficiency. The unreliability of conventional spectrum sensing methods by using measurements from a single secondary user (SU) has motivated research on cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS). In this work, we propose a vertical federated learning (VFL) framework to exploit the distributed features across multiple SUs without compromising the data privacy. However, the repetitive training process in VFL faces the issue of high communication latency. To accelerate the training process, we propose a truncated vertical federated learning (T-VFL) algorithm, where the training latency is highly reduced by integrating the standard VFL algorithm with a channel-aware user scheduling policy. The convergence performance of T-VFL is provided via mathematical analysis and justified by simulation results. Moreover, to guarantee the convergence performance of the T-VFL algorithm, we conclude three design rules on the neural architectures used under the VFL framework, whose effectiveness is proved through simulations"}
