{"abstract":"Accurate traffic-flow prediction remains a critical challenge due to complicated spatial dependencies, temporal factors, and unpredictable events. Most existing approaches focus on single- or dual-view learning and thus face limitations in systematically learning complex spatial-temporal features. In this work, we propose a novel multiview spatial-temporal transformer (MVSTT) network that can effectively learn complex spatial-temporal domain correlations and potential patterns from multiple views. First, we examine a temporal view and design a short-range gated convolution component from a short-term subview, and a long-range gated convolution component from a long-term subview. These two components effectively aggregate knowledge of the temporal domain at multiple granularities and mine patterns of node evolution across time steps. Meanwhile, in the spatial view, we design a dual-graph spatial learning module that captures fixed and dynamic spatial dependencies of nodes, as well as the evolution patterns of edges, from the static and dynamic graph subviews, respectively. In addition, we further design a spatial-temporal transformer to mine different levels of spatial-temporal features through multiview knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets show that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline. The code of MVSTT is available at https://github.com/JianSoL/MVSTT."}
