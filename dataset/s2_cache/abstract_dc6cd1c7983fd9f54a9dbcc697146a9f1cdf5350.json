{"abstract":". We present PASS , a tool that analyzes concurrent probabilistic programs, which map to potentially inﬁnite Markov decision processes. PASS is based on predicate abstraction and abstraction reﬁnement and scales to programs far beyond the reach of numerical methods which operate on the full state space of the model. The computational engines we use are SMT solvers to compute ﬁnite abstractions, numerical meth-ods to compute probabilities and interpolation as part of abstraction reﬁnement. PASS has been successfully applied to network protocols and serves as a test platform for diﬀerent reﬁnement methods."}
