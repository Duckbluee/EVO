{"abstract":"The rapid development of the Internet has caused information overload, and recommendation algorithms have emerged. In recent years, graph neural network (GNN) has been increasingly used in recommendation algorithms due to its strong performance in learning the node and relationship representation of networks. Based on the perspective of graph structure, this paper provides a new taxonomy of graph neural networks for recommendation models, and introduces the latest typical models in each category. We compare the differences and commonalities of different models from the step of information aggregation and information combination of graph neural networks, and summarize the challenges and difficulties still faced by GNN recommendation, hoping to provide reference for future research."}
