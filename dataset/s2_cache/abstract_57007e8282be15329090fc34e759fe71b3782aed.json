{"abstract":"Video anomaly detection is an essential but challenging task. The prevalent methods mainly investigate the reconstruction difference between normal and abnormal patterns but ignore the semantics consistency between appearance and motion information of behavior patterns, making the results highly dependent on the local context of frame sequences and lacking the understanding of behavior semantics. To address this issue, we propose a framework of Appearance-Motion Semantics Representation Consistency that uses the gap of appearance and motion semantic representation consistency between normal and abnormal data. The two-stream structure is designed to encode the appearance and motion information representation of normal samples, and a novel consistency loss is proposed to enhance the consistency of feature semantics so that anomalies with low consistency can be identified. Moreover, the lower consistency features of anomalies can be used to deteriorate the quality of the predicted frame, which makes anomalies easier to spot. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}
