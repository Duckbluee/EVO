{"abstract":"The massive spread of misinformation in social networks has become a global risk, implicitly influencing public opinion and threatening social/political development. Misinformation detection (MID) has thus become a surging research topic in recent years. As a promising and rapid developing research field, we find that many efforts have been paid to new research problems and approaches of MID. Therefore, it is necessary to give a comprehensive review of the new research trends of MID. We first give a brief review of the literature history of MID, based on which we present several new research challenges and techniques of it, including early detection, detection by multimodal data fusion, and explanatory detection. We further investigate the extraction and usage of various crowd intelligence in MID, which paves a promising way to tackle MID challenges. Finally, we give our own views on the open issues and future research directions of MID, such as model adaptivity/generality to new events, embracing of novel machine learning models, explanatory detection models, and so on."}
