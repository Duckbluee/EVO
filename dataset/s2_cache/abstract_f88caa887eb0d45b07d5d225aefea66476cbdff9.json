{"abstract":"The goal of Cross-Domain Few-Shot Classification (CDFSC) is to accurately classify a target dataset with limited labelled data by exploiting the knowledge of a richly labelled auxiliary dataset, despite the differences between the domains of the two datasets. Some existing approaches require labelled samples from multiple domains for model training. However, these methods fail when the sample labels are scarce. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a solution that makes use of multiple source domains without the need for additional labeling costs. Specifically, one of the source domains is completely tagged, while the others are untagged. An Inter-Source Stylization Network (ISSNet) is then introduced to enhance stylisation across multiple source domains, enriching data distribution and model’s generalization capabilities. Experiments on 8 target datasets show that ISSNet leverages unlabelled data from multiple source data and significantly reduces the negative impact of domain gaps on classification performance compared to several baseline methods."}
