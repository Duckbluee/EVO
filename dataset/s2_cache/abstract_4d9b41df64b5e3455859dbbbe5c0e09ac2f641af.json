{"abstract":"Software engineering (SE) research has traditionally revolved around engineering the source code. However, novel approaches that analyze software through computer vision have been increasingly adopted in SE. These approaches allow analyzing the software from a different complementary perspective other than the source code, and they are used to either complement existing source code-based methods, or to overcome their limitations. The goal of this manuscript is to survey the use of computer vision techniques in SE with the aim of assessing their potential in advancing the field of SE research. We examined an extensive body of literature from top-tier SE venues, as well as venues from closely related fields (machine learning, computer vision, and human-computer interaction). Our inclusion criteria targeted papers applying computer vision techniques that address problems related to any area of SE. We collected an initial pool of 2,716 papers, from which we obtained 66 final relevant papers covering a variety of SE areas. We analyzed what computer vision techniques have been adopted or designed, for what reasons, how they are used, what benefits they provide, and how they are evaluated. Our findings highlight that visual approaches have been adopted in a wide variety of SE tasks, predominantly for effectively tackling software analysis and testing challenges in the web and mobile domains. The results also show a rapid growth trend of the use of computer vision techniques in SE research."}
