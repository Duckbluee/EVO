{"abstract":"Controllable video generation has gained significant attention in recent years. However, two main limitations persist: Firstly, most existing works focus on either text, image, or trajectory-based control, leading to an inability to achieve fine-grained control in videos. Secondly, trajectory control research is still in its early stages, with most experiments being conducted on simple datasets like Human3.6M. This constraint limits the models' capability to process open-domain images and effectively handle complex curved trajectories. In this paper, we propose DragNUWA, an open-domain diffusion-based video generation model. To tackle the issue of insufficient control granularity in existing works, we simultaneously introduce text, image, and trajectory information to provide fine-grained control over video content from semantic, spatial, and temporal perspectives. To resolve the problem of limited open-domain trajectory control in current research, We propose trajectory modeling with three aspects: a Trajectory Sampler (TS) to enable open-domain control of arbitrary trajectories, a Multiscale Fusion (MF) to control trajectories in different granularities, and an Adaptive Training (AT) strategy to generate consistent videos following trajectories. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of DragNUWA, demonstrating its superior performance in fine-grained control in video generation.
