{"abstract":"The quality of a Knowledge Graph (also known as Linked Data) is an important aspect to indicate its fitness for use in an application. Several quality dimensions are identified, such as accuracy, completeness, timeliness, provenance, and accessibility, which are used to assess the quality. While many prior studies offer a landscape view of data quality dimensions, here we focus on presenting a systematic literature review for assessing the completeness of Knowledge Graph. We gather existing approaches from the literature and analyze them qualitatively and quantitatively. In particular, we unify and formalize commonly used terminologies across 56 articles related to the completeness dimension of data quality and provide a comprehensive list of methodologies and metrics used to evaluate the different types of completeness. We identify seven types of completeness, including three types that were not previously identified in previous surveys. We also analyze nine different tools capable of assessing Knowledge Graph completeness. The aim of this Systematic Literature Review is to provide researchers and data curators a comprehensive and deeper understanding of existing works on completeness and its properties, thereby encouraging further experimentation and development of new approaches focused on completeness as a data quality dimension of Knowledge Graph."}
