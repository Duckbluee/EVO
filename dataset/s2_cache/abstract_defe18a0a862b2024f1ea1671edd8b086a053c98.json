{"abstract":"OBJECTIVES\nTo enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) by introducing a domain-specific instruction dataset and examining its impact when combined with multi-task learning principles.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe created the BioInstruct, comprising 25 005 instructions to instruction-tune LLMs (LLaMA 1 and 2, 7B and 13B version). The instructions were created by prompting the GPT-4 language model with 3-seed samples randomly drawn from an 80 human curated instructions. We employed Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We then evaluated these instruction-tuned LLMs on several BioNLP tasks, which can be grouped into 3 major categories: question answering (QA), information extraction (IE), and text generation (GEN). We also examined whether categories (eg, QA, IE, and generation) of instructions impact model performance.\n\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nComparing with LLMs without instruction-tuned, our instruction-tuned LLMs demonstrated marked performance gains: 17.3% in QA on average accuracy metric, 5.7% in IE on average F1 metric, and 96% in Generation tasks on average GPT-4 score metric. Our 7B-parameter instruction-tuned LLaMA 1 model was competitive or even surpassed other LLMs in the biomedical domain that were also fine-tuned from LLaMA 1 with vast domain-specific data or a variety of tasks. Our results also show that the performance gain is significantly higher when instruction fine-tuning is conducted with closely related tasks. Our findings align with the observations of multi-task learning, suggesting the synergies between 2 tasks.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe BioInstruct dataset serves as a valuable resource and instruction tuned LLMs lead to the best performing BioNLP applications."}
