{"abstract":"The Hawkes process has become a standard method for modeling self-exciting event sequences with different event types. A recent work generalizing the Hawkes process to a neurally self-modulating multivariate point process enables the capturing of more complex and realistic influences of past events on the future. However, this approach is limited by the number of event types, making it impossible to model the dynamics of evolving graph sequences, where each possible link between two nodes can be considered as an event type. The problem becomes even more dramatic when links are directional and labeled, since, in this case, the number of event types scales with the number of nodes and link types. To address this issue, we propose the Graph Hawkes Network to capture the dynamics of evolving graph sequences. Extensive experiments on large-scale temporal relational databases, such as temporal knowledge graphs, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}
