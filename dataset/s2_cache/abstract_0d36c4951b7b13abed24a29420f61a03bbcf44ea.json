{"abstract":"Three-dimensional object detection utilizing LiDAR point cloud data is an indispensable part of autonomous driving perception systems. Point cloud-based 3D object detection has been a better replacement for higher accuracy than cameras during nighttime. However, most LiDAR-based 3D object methods work in a supervised manner, which means their state-of-the-art performance relies heavily on a large-scale and well-labeled dataset, while these annotated datasets could be expensive to obtain and only accessible in the limited scenario. Transfer learning is a promising approach to reduce the large-scale training datasets requirement, but existing transfer learning object detectors are primarily for 2D object detection rather than 3D. In this work, we utilize the 3D point cloud data more effectively by representing the birds-eye-view (BEV) scene and propose a transfer learning based point cloud semantic segmentation for 3D object detection. The proposed model minimizes the need for large-scale training datasets and consequently reduces the training time. First, a preprocessing stage filters the raw point cloud data to a BEV map within a specific field of view. Second, the transfer learning stage uses knowledge from the previously learned classification task (with more data for training) and generalizes the semantic segmentation-based 2D object detection task. Finally, 2D detection results from the BEV image have been back-projected into 3D in the postprocessing stage. We verify results on two datasets: the KITTI 3D object detection dataset and the Ouster LiDAR-64 dataset, thus demonstrating that the proposed method is highly competitive in terms of mean average precision (mAP up to 70%) while still running at more than 30 frames per second (FPS)."}
