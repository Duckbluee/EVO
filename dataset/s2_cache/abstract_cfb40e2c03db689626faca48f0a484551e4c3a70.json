{"abstract":"This brief addresses resiliency of continuous-time linear multi-agent systems with malicious nodes. All normal nodes are guaranteed to achieve resilient consensus by the proposed resilient algorithm such that they all converge to a safety interval related to the initial states of normal nodes regardless a certain number of adversaries. Different graph conditions are provided to tolerant <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$f$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-total as well as <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$f$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-local type of malicious nodes respectively. Simulations on practical aircraft systems demonstrate the efficacy of our strategy."}
