{"abstract":"Recommender systems across many Internet services have become a critical part of online businesses, as consumers would refer to them before making decisions. However, the lack of explicit ratings for items on many services makes it challenging to capture user preferences and item characteristics. Both academia and the industry have drawn attention to rating predications as a fundamental problem in recommendation systems. With the emergence of social networks, social recommender systems have been proposed to utilize the relationship between users and items to alleviate the data sparsity problem for rating predictions. However, they either concentrate on the opinion mining for each user and item, or consider the connections between users only. In this paper, we present an effective framework, Triple-hierarchical Attention Graph-based social rating prediction (TAG), to exploit the social relationships between users, the user-item interest relationships, the correlation relationships between items, and reviews for rating predictions. In order to consider opinions from reviews and these complex relationships, we first employ two triple-hierarchical attention to extract user and item features from reviews. We then design an inductive GNN, which generates effective embedding for users and items. Experiments over Yelp show that TAG outperforms state-of-the-art methods across RMSE, MAE, and NDCG metrics."}
