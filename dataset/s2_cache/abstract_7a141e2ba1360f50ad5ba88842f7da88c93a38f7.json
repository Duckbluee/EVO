{"abstract":"Deep reinforcement learning has been successfully used in many dynamic decision making domains, especially those with very large state spaces. However, it is also well-known that deep reinforcement learning can be very slow and resource intensive. The resulting system is often brittle and difficult to explain. In this paper, we attempt to address some of these problems by proposing a framework of Rule-interposing Learning (RIL) that embeds high level rules into the deep reinforcement learning. With some good rules, this framework not only can accelerate the learning process, but also keep it away from catastrophic explorations, thus making the system relatively stable even during the very early stage of training. Moreover, given the rules are high level and easy to interpret, they can be easily maintained, updated and shared with other similar tasks."}
