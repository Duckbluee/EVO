{"abstract":"More than 300 million people have been affected by depression all over the world. Due to the medical equipment and knowledge limitations, most of them are not diagnosed at the early stages. Recent work attempts to use social media to detect depression since the patterns of opinions and thoughts expression of the posted text and images, can reflect users' mental state to some extent. In this work, we design a system dubbed SenseMood to demonstrate that the users with depression can be efficiently detected and analyzed by using proposed system. A deep visual-textual multimodal learning approach has been proposed to reveal the psychological state of the users on social networks. The posted images and tweets data from users with/without depression on Twitter have been collected and used for depression detection. CNN-based classifier and Bert are applied to extract the deep features from the pictures and text posted by users respectively. Then visual and textual features are combined to reflect the emotional expression of users. Finally our system classifies the users with depression and normal users through a neural network and the analysis report is generated automatically."}
