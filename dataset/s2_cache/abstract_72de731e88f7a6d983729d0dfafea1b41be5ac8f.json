{"abstract":"Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art generative performance and have been used as strong pixel-level representation learners. This paper decomposes the interrelation between the generative capability and representation learning ability inherent in diffusion models. We present the masked diffusion model (MDM), a scalable self-supervised representation learner for semantic segmentation, substituting the conventional additive Gaussian noise of traditional diffusion with a masking mechanism. Our proposed approach convincingly surpasses prior benchmarks, demonstrating remarkable advancements in both medical and natural image semantic segmentation tasks, particularly in few-shot scenarios."}
