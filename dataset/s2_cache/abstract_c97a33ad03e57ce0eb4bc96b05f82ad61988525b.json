{"abstract":"Achieving the optimal balance of minimizing bandwidth consumption and end-to-end latency while preserving a satisfactory level of visual quality becomes the ultimate goal of live, interactive holographic communication, a fundamental building block of immersive telepresence envisioned for 6G. Nevertheless, achieving this ambitious goal poses significant challenges for mobile devices with limited computing power, considering the substantial amount of 3D data to stream, the demanding latency requirements, and the high computation workload involved. Instead of distributing immersive content bit by bit, in this position paper, we propose to deliver semantic information extracted from telepresence participants to drastically reduce Internet bandwidth usage for task-oriented applications such as remote collaboration. We contribute a taxonomy by categorizing related semantics into three different types (i.e., keypoints, 2D images, and text), pinpoint the open research challenges associated with developing a practical system for each category in our comprehensive research agenda, and delve into the potential solutions for overcoming these challenges. The preliminary results from our proof-of-concept implementation that harnesses keypoint-based semantics (partially) validate the feasibility of our research agenda."}
