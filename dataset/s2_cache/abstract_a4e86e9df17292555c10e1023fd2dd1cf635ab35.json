{"abstract":"Anomaly detection generally involves the extraction of features from entities' or users' properties, and the design of anomaly detection models using machine learning or deep learning algorithms. However, only considering entities' property information could lead to high false positives. We posit the importance of also considering connections or relationships between entities in the detecting of anomalous behaviors and associated threat groups. Therefore, in this paper, we design a GCN (graph convolutional networks) based anomaly detection model to detect anomalous behaviors of users and malicious threat groups. The GCN model could characterize entities' properties and structural information between them into graphs. This allows the GCN based anomaly detection model to detect both anomalous behaviors of individuals and associated anomalous groups. We then evaluate the proposed model using a real-world insider threat data set. The results show that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-art baseline methods (i.e., random forest, logistic regression, SVM, and CNN). Moreover, the proposed model can also be applied to other anomaly detection applications."}
