{"abstract":"Many social studies and practical cases suggest that people's consumption behaviors and social behaviors are not isolated but interrelated in social network services. However, most existing research either predicts users’ consumption preferences or recommends friends to users without dealing with them simultaneously. We propose a holistic approach to predict users’ preferences on friends and items jointly and thereby make better recommendations. To this end, we design a graph neural network that incorporates a mutualistic mechanism to model the mutual reinforcement relationship between users’ consumption behaviors and social behaviors. Our experiments on the two-real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in both social recommendation and link prediction."}
