{"abstract":"Nowadays, with the rapid development of social media, there is a great deal of news produced every day. How to detect fake news automatically from a large of multimedia posts has become very important for people, the government and news recommendation sites. However, most of the existing approaches either extract features from the text of the post which is a single modality or simply concatenate the visual features and textual features of a post to get a multimodal feature and detect fake news. Most of them ignore the background knowledge hidden in the text content of the post which facilitates fake news detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel Knowledge-driven Multimodal Graph Convolutional Network (KMGCN) to model the semantic representations by jointly modeling the textual information, knowledge concepts and visual information into a unified framework for fake news detection. Instead of viewing text content as word sequences normally, we convert them into a graph, which can model non-consecutive phrases for better obtaining the composition of semantics. Besides, we not only convert visual information as nodes of graphs but also retrieve external knowledge from real-world knowledge graph as nodes of graphs to provide complementary semantics information to improve fake news detection. We utilize a well-designed graph convolutional network to extract the semantic representation of these graphs. Extensive experiments on two public real-world datasets illustrate the validation of our approach."}
