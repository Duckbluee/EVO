{"abstract":"Intel Software Guard Extensions (\\kw{SGX}) provides a trusted execution environment (\\kw{TEE}) to run code and operate sensitive data.\\kw{SGX} provides runtime hardware protection where both code and data are protected even if other code components are malicious.However, recently many attacks targeting \\kw{SGX} have been identified and introduced that can thwart the hardware defence provided by \\kw{SGX}.In this paper we present a survey of all attacks specifically targeting Intel \\kw{SGX} that are known to the authors, to date.We categorized the attacks based on their implementation details into 7 different categories.We also look into the available defence mechanisms against identified attacks and categorize the available types of mitigations for each presented attack.
