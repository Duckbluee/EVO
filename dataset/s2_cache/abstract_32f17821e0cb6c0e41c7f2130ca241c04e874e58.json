{"abstract":". We propose a malware classiﬁcation system that is shown to be robust to some common intra-procedural obfuscation techniques. In-deed, by training the Contextual Graph Markov Model on the call graph representation of a program, we classify it using only topological information, which is unaﬀected by such obfuscations. In particular, we show that the structure of the call graph is suﬃcient to achieve good accuracy on a multi-class classiﬁcation benchmark."}
