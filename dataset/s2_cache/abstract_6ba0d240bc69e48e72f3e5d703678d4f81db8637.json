{"abstract":"With the popularity of online learning in educational settings, knowledge tracing (KT) plays an increasingly significant role. The task of KT is to help students learn more effectively by predicting their next mastery of knowledge based on their historical exercise sequences. Nowadays, many related works have emerged in this field, such as Bayesian knowledge tracing and deep knowledge tracing methods. Despite the progress that has been made in KT, existing techniques still have the following limitations: 1) Previous studies address KT by only exploring the observational sparsity data distribution, and the counterfactual data distribution has been largely ignored. 2) Current works designed for KT only consider either the entity relationships between questions and concepts, or the relations between two concepts, and none of them investigates the relations among students, questions, and concepts, simultaneously, leading to inaccurate student modeling. To address the above limitations, we propose a graph counterfactual augmentation method for knowledge tracing. Concretely, to consider the multiple relationships among different entities, we first uniform students, questions, and concepts in graphs, and then leverage a heterogeneous graph convolutional network to conduct representation learning. To model the counterfactual world, we conduct counterfactual transformations on students' learning graphs by changing the corresponding treatments and then exploit the counterfactual outcomes in a contrastive learning framework. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed GraphCA method compared with several state-of-the-art baselines."}
