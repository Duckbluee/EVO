{"abstract":"Recommender systems have been widely applied in different real-life scenarios to help us find useful information. In particular, reinforcement learning (RL)-based recommender systems have become an emerging research topic in recent years, owing to the interactive nature and autonomous learning ability. Empirical results show that RL-based recommendation methods often surpass supervised learning methods. Nevertheless, there are various challenges in applying RL in recommender systems. To understand the challenges and relevant solutions, there should be a reference for researchers and practitioners working on RL-based recommender systems. To this end, we first provide a thorough overview, comparisons, and summarization of RL approaches applied in four typical recommendation scenarios, including interactive recommendation, conversational recommendation, sequential recommendation, and explainable recommendation. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the challenges and relevant solutions on the basis of existing literature. Finally, under discussion for open issues of RL and its limitations of recommender systems, we highlight some potential research directions in this field."}
