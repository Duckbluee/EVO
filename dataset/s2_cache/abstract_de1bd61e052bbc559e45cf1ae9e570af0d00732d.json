{"abstract":"Abstract Application-level monitoring and dynamic analysis of software systems are a basis for various tasks in software engineering research, such as performance evaluation and reverse engineering. The Kieker framework provides monitoring, analysis, and visualization support for these purposes. It commenced in 2006, and grew toward a high-quality open-source software that has been employed in a variety of software engineering research projects over the last decade. Several research groups constitute the open-source community to advance the Kieker framework. In this paper, we review Kieker’s history, development, and impact both in research and technology transfer with industry."}
