{"abstract":"Although data has become an important kind of commercial goods, there are few appropriate online platforms to facilitate the trading of mobile crowd-sensed data so far. In this paper, we present the first architecture of mobile crowd-sensed data market, and conduct an in-depth study of the design problem of online data pricing and reward sharing. To build a practical mobile crowd-sensed data market, we have to consider four major design challenges: data uncertainty, economic-robustness (arbitrage-freeness in particular), profit maximization, and fair reward sharing. By jointly considering the design challenges, we propose an online query-bAsed cRowd-sensEd daTa pricing mEchanism, namely ARETE-PR, to determine the trading price of crowd-sensed data. Our theoretical analysis shows that ARETE-PR guarantees both arbitrage-freeness and a constant competitive ratio in terms of profit maximization. Based on some fairness criterions, we further design a reward sharing scheme, namely ARETE-SH, which is closely coupled with ARETE-PR, to incentivize data providers to contribute data. We have evaluated ARETE on a real-world sensory data set collected by Intel Berkeley lab. Evaluation results show that ARETE-PR outperforms the state-of-the-art pricing mechanisms, and achieves around 90 percent of the optimal revenue. ARETE-SH distributes the reward among data providers in a fair way."}
