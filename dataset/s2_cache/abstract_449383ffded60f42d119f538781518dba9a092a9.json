{"abstract":"The task of semantic segmentation is an important one in the context of 3D building modelling. Indeed, developments in 3D generation techniques have rendered the point cloud ubiquitous. However pure data acquisition only captures geometric information and semantic classification remains to be performed, often manually, in order to give a tangible sense to the 3D data. Recently progress in computing power also opened the way for massive application of deep learning methods, including for semantic segmentation purposes. Although well established in the processing of 2D images, deep learning solutions remain an open question for 3D data. In this study, we aim to benefit from the vastly more developed 2D semantic segmentation by performing transfer learning on a photogrammetric orthoimage. The neural network was trained using labelled and rectified images of building façades. Another programme was then written to permit the passage between 2D orthoimage and 3D point cloud. Results show that the approach worked well and presents an alternative to help the automation process for point cloud semantic segmentation, at least in the case of photogrammetric data. * Corresponding author"}
