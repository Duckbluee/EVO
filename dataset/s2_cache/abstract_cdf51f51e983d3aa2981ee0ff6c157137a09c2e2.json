{"abstract":"Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most widely used brain-activity recording methods in non-invasive brain-machine interfaces (BCIs). However, EEG data is highly nonlinear, and its datasets often suffer from issues such as data heterogeneity, label uncertainty and data/label scarcity. To address these, we propose a domain independent, end-to-end semi-supervised learning framework with contrastive learning and adversarial training strategies. Our method was evaluated in experiments with different amounts of labels and an ablation study in a motor imagery EEG dataset. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework with two different backbone deep neural networks show improved performance over their supervised counterparts under the same condition."}
