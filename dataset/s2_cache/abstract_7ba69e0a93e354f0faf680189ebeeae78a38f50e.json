{"abstract":"Random hyperbolic graphs were recently introduced by Krioukov et. al. [KPKVB10] as a model for large networks. Gugelmann, Panagiotou, and Peter [GPP12] then initiated the rigorous study of random hyperbolic graphs using the following model: for $\\alpha> \\tfrac{1}{2}$, $C\\in\\mathbb{R}$, $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, set $R=2\\ln n+C$ and build the graph $G=(V,E)$ with $|V|=n$ as follows: For each $v\\in V$, generate i.i.d. polar coordinates $(r_{v},\\theta_{v})$ using the joint density function $f(r,\\theta)$, with $\\theta_{v}$ chosen uniformly from $[0,2\\pi)$ and $r_{v}$ with density $f(r)=\\frac{\\alpha\\sinh(\\alpha r)}{\\cosh(\\alpha R)-1}$ for $0\\leq r< R$. Then, join two vertices by an edge, if their hyperbolic distance is at most $R$. We prove that in the range $\\tfrac{1}{2} < \\alpha < 1$ a.a.s. for any two vertices of the same component, their graph distance is $O(\\log^{C_0+1+o(1)}n)$, where $C_0=2/(\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\frac{3}{4}\\alpha+\\tfrac{\\alpha^2}{4})$, thus answering a question raised in [GPP12] concerning the diameter of such random graphs. As a corollary from our proof we obtain that the second largest component has size $O(\\log^{2C_0+1+o(1)}n)$, thus answering a question of Bode, Fountoulakis and M\\\"{u}ller [BFM13]. We also show that a.a.s. there exist isolated components forming a path of length $\\Omega(\\log n)$, thus yielding a lower bound on the size of the second largest component."}
