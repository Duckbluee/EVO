{"abstract":"Graphs have been widely used to represent complex data in many applications, such as e-commerce, social networks, and bioinformatics. Efficient and effective analysis of graph data is important for graph-based applications. However, most graph analysis tasks are combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, which are NP-hard. Recent studies have focused a lot on the potential of using machine learning (ML) to solve graph-based CO problems. Using ML- based CO methods, a graph has to be represented in numerical vectors, which is known as graph embedding. In this survey, we provide a thorough overview of recent graph embedding methods that have been used to solve CO problems. Most graph embedding methods have two stages: graph preprocessing and ML model learning. This survey classifies graph embedding works from the perspective of graph preprocessing tasks and ML models. Furthermore, this survey summarizes recent graph-based CO methods that exploit graph embedding. In particular, graph embedding can be employed as part of classification techniques or can be combined with search methods to find solutions to CO problems. The survey ends with several remarks on future research directions."}
