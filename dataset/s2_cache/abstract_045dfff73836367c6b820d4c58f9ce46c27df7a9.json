{"abstract":"Today's modern game that many children play is mobile-based. The rapid development of smartphones makes mobile gaming technology develop too. Traditional games have been developed in Indonesia. The purpose of elevating traditional games into mobile game applications is so that children now know the traditional game of the nation's culture even though it is now in the digital age. One of the traditional games raised in mobile games is Stilts. This study discusses the evaluation of traditional Egrang game application users. Respondents from this study are children aged 7 to 13 years. The tool used for processing and analyzing respondent data is the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ). UEQ will measure 6 User Experience scales, including Attractiveness, Perspicuity, Efficiency, Dependability, Stimulation, and Novelty. The results of this study obtained Perspicuity and Novelty Scale data in the Above Average range. Attractiveness, Efficiency, and Dependability scales are in the Below Average range.In contrast, the Stimulation scale is in the Bad range. From these data, it can be seen that the stimulation scale most needs to get more attention in the evaluation or development of subsequent applications. In contrast, the one who gets the highest score is Perspicuity. So it can be concluded that respondents said the game was easy to understand when playing for the first time but was still not motivated to play it repeatedly and tended to get bored quickly."}
