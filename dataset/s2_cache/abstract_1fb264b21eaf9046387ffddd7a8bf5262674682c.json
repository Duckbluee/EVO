{"abstract":"Transformer-based models have recently shown success in representation learning on graph-structured data beyond natural language processing and computer vision. However, the success is limited to small-scale graphs due to the drawbacks of full dot-product attention on graphs such as the <italic>quadratic</italic> complexity with respect to the number of nodes and message aggregation from enormous <italic>irrelevant</italic> nodes. To address these issues, we propose Deformable Graph Transformer (DGT) that performs sparse attention via dynamically selected <italic>relevant</italic> nodes for efficiently handling large-scale graphs with a <italic>linear</italic> complexity in the number of nodes. Specifically, our framework first constructs multiple node sequences with various criteria to consider both structural and semantic proximity. Then, combining with our learnable Katz Positional Encodings, the sparse attention is applied to the node sequences for learning node representations with a significantly reduced computational cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DGT achieves superior performance on 7 graph benchmark datasets with 2.5 <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\sim$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"kim-ieq1-3550281.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> 449 times less computational cost compared to transformer-based graph models with full attention."}
