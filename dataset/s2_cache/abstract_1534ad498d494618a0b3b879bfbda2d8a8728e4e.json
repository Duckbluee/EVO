Our dataset incorporates data from traditionally underrepresented scenes such as indoor environments and pedestrian areas, all from the ego-perspective of the robot, both stationary and navigating. The dataset has been annotated with over 2.4 million bounding boxes spread over five individual cameras and 1.8 million associated 3D cuboids around all people in the scenes totaling over 3500 time consistent trajectories. Together with our dataset and the annotations, we launch a benchmark and metrics for 2D and 3D person detection and tracking. With this dataset, which we plan on extending with further types of annotation in the future, we hope to provide a new source of data and a test-bench for research in the areas of egocentric robot vision, autonomous navigation, and all perceptual tasks around social robotics in human environments."}
