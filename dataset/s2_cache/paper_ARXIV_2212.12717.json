This motivates us to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on stock market prediction. We present four elaborated subtasks of stock market prediction and propose a novel taxonomy to summarize the state-of-the-art models based on deep neural networks. In addition, we also provide detailed statistics on the datasets and evaluation metrics commonly used in the stock market. Finally, we point out several future directions by sharing some new perspectives on stock market prediction."}
