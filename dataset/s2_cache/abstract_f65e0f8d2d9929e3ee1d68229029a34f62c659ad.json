{"abstract":"Transfer learning is an important approach that produces pre-trained teacher models which can be used to quickly build specialized student models. However, recent research on transfer learning has found that it is vulnerable to various attacks, e.g., misclassification and backdoor attacks. However, it is still not clear whether transfer learning is vulnerable to model inversion attacks. Launching a model inversion attack against transfer learning scheme is challenging. Not only does the student model hide its structural parameters, but it is also inaccessible to the adversary. Hence, when targeting a student model, both the white-box and black-box versions of existing model inversion attacks fail. White-box attacks fail as they need the target model's parameters. Black-box attacks fail as they depend on making repeated queries of the target model. However, they may not mean that transfer learning models are impervious to model inversion attacks. Hence, with this paper, we initiate research into model inversion attacks against transfer learning schemes with two novel attack methods. Both are black-box attacks, suiting different situations, that do not rely on queries to the target student model. In the first method, the adversary has the data samples that share the same distribution as the training set of the teacher model. In the second method, the adversary does not have any such samples. Experiments show that highly recognizable data records can be recovered with both of these methods. This means that even if a model is an inaccessible black-box, it can still be inverted."}
