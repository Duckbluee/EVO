{"abstract":"Influence maximization is an important technique for its significant value on various social network applications, such as viral marketing, advertisement, and recommendation. Traditional heuristic algorithms for influence maximization suffer from different issues, such as accuracy descent and information loss during network exploration. Besides, recently proposed deep learning-based approaches cannot extract the in-depth structural information of social networks well. In light of these problems, we propose a novel heuristic method called the network dynamic GCN influence maximization algorithm based on the leader fake labeling mechanism. To exploit the in-depth network topology information for the influence maximization task, we design a network dynamic GCN that owns adaptive layer numbers in terms of different network scales to obtain node representations. Then, considering that there are few labels in the network or the labels are irrelevant to the task of influence maximization, we establish a leader fake labeling mechanism to automatically generate node labels that are helpful to seed nodes selecting for model training. Finally, a heuristic method based on the Mahalanobis distance is developed to quickly select influential seed nodes with the learned node representations. Three real-world datasets are used in our experiments, and the experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm has a better performance for seed set identification under the premise of high efficiency compared with some latest heuristic influence maximization algorithms."}
