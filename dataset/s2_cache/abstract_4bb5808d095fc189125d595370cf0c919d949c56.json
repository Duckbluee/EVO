{"abstract":"We propose a multi-task ensemble framework that jointly learns multiple related problems. The ensemble model aims to leverage the learned representations of three deep learning models (i.e., CNN, LSTM and GRU) and a hand-crafted feature representation for the predictions. Through multi-task framework, we address four problems of emotion and sentiment analysis, i.e., “emotion <italic>classification</italic> & <italic>intensity</italic>”, “<italic>valence</italic>, <italic>arousal</italic> & <italic>dominance</italic> for emotion”, “<italic>valence</italic> & <italic>arousal</italic> for sentiment”, and “<italic>3-class categorical</italic> & <italic>5-class ordinal classification</italic> for sentiment”. The underlying problems cover two granularity (i.e., <italic>coarse-grained</italic> and <italic>fine-grained</italic>) and a diverse range of domains (i.e., <italic>tweets</italic>, <italic>Facebook posts</italic>, <italic>news headlines</italic>, <italic>blogs</italic>, <italic>letters</italic> etc.). Experimental results suggest that the proposed multi-task framework outperforms the single-task frameworks in all experiments."}
