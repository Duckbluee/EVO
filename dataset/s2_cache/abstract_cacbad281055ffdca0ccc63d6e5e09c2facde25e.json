{"abstract":"Class imbalance and concept drift are two primary principles that exist concurrently in data stream classification. Although the two issues have drawn enough attention separately, the joint treatment largely remains unexplored. Moreover, the class imbalance issue is further complicated if data streams with concept drift. A novel Cost-Sensitive based Data Stream (CSDS) classification is introduced to overcome the two issues simultaneously. The CSDS considers cost information during the procedures of data preprocessing and classification. During the data preprocessing, a cost-sensitive learning strategy is introduced into the ReliefF algorithm for alleviating the class imbalance at the data level. In the classification process, a cost-sensitive weighting schema is devised to enhance the overall performance of the ensemble. Besides, a change detection mechanism is embedded in our algorithm, which guarantees that an ensemble can capture and react to drift promptly. Experimental results validate that our method can obtain better classification results under different imbalanced concept drifting data stream scenarios."}
