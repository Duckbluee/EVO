{"abstract":"The problem of out-of-distribution detection for graph classiﬁcation is far from being solved. The existing models tend to be overconﬁdent about OOD examples or completely ignore the detection task. In this work, we consider this problem from the uncertainty estimation perspective and perform the comparison of several recently proposed methods. In our experiments, we ﬁnd that there is no universal approach for OOD detection, and it is important to consider both graph representations and predictive categorical distribution."}
