{"abstract":"This research aims to improve the user interface of SIAK-NG (Next Generation Academic Information System), the academic portal website of the University of Indonesia through a design thinking approach. Despite being in existence for several decades and undergoing multiple improvements, there has been no specific effort to evaluate the quality of the user interface. In line with the revamping of SIAK-NG according to the University of Indonesia 2019-2024 master plan, this study aims to provide the necessary insights. The research focuses on redesigning the website interface of SIAK-NG to address user complaints and difficulties, particularly related to the unsatisfactory interface design. The Design Thinking approach is employed to generate solutions that meet the needs of active University of Indonesia students who are the primary users. Through methods such as storyboarding, empathy mapping, usability testing, and others, the author will design recommendations that align with user requirements."}
