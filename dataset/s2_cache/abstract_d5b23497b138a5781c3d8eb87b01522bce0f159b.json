{"abstract":"Malware detection is one of the most important factors in the security of smartphones. Academic researchers have extensively studied Android malware detection problems. Machine learning methods proposed in previous work typically reported high detection performance and fast prediction times on fixed and defective datasets. Therefore, based on these shortcomings most datasets are not suitable for real-world deployment. The main goal of this paper is to propose a systematic approach to generate Android malware datasets using real smartphones instead of emulators and develop a new dataset, namely CI-CAndMal2017, which covers all the shortcomings and limitations of previous datasets. Also, we offer 80 traffic features to select the best feature sets for detecting and classifying the malicious families just by traffic analysis. The proposed method showed an average precision of 85% and recall of 88% for three classifiers, namely Random Forest(RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Decision Tree (DT)."}
