{"abstract":"Decentralized crypto-currencies based on the blockchain architecture under-utilize available network bandwidth, making them unable to scale to thousands of transactions per second. We define the Blockclique architecture, that addresses this limitation by sharding transactions in a block graph with a fixed number of threads. The architecture allows the creation of intrinsically compatible blocks in parallel, where each block references one previous block of each thread. The consistency of the Blockclique protocol is formally established in presence of attackers. An experimental evaluation of the architecture's performance in large realistic networks demonstrates an efficient use of available bandwidth and a throughput of thousands of transactions per second."}
