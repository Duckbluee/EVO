{"abstract":"Information and communication technology (ICT) has been an essential part of modern society. However, the current communication systems are not sufficient to meet the demands of emerging applications. Intellicise (intelligent and concise) wireless networks, with their inherent characteristics of intelligence-endogenous and primitive-concise, have been proposed as a promising research direction. In this paper, we focus on intellicise wireless networks from semantic communication (SemCom). We present a comprehensive framework of intellicise wireless networks, including components such as brain for intellicise wireless networks (BIWN), intellicise signal processing, intellicise information transmission, intellicise network organization, and intellicise service bearing. We also investigate the enabling technologies and driving factors of intellicise wireless networks. Subsequently, we introduce the applications of intellicise wireless networks and envision new services. Finally, we outline the challenges of implementing intellicise wireless networks from a broad perspective and discuss possible solutions."}
