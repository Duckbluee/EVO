{"abstract":"Driven by the large foundation models, the development of artificial intelligence has witnessed tremendous progress lately, leading to a surge of general interest from the public. In this study, we aim to assess the performance of OpenAI's newest model, GPT-4V(ision), specifically in the realm of multimodal medical diagnosis. Our evaluation encompasses 17 human body systems, including Central Nervous System, Head and Neck, Cardiac, Chest, Hematology, Hepatobiliary, Gastrointestinal, Urogenital, Gynecology, Obstetrics, Breast, Musculoskeletal, Spine, Vascular, Oncology, Trauma, Pediatrics, with images taken from 8 modalities used in daily clinic routine, e.g., X-ray, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA), Mammography, Ultrasound, and Pathology. We probe the GPT-4V's ability on multiple clinical tasks with or without patent history provided, including imaging modality and anatomy recognition, disease diagnosis, report generation, disease localisation. Our observation shows that, while GPT-4V demonstrates proficiency in distinguishing between medical image modalities and anatomy, it faces significant challenges in disease diagnosis and generating comprehensive reports. These findings underscore that while large multimodal models have made significant advancements in computer vision and natural language processing, it remains far from being used to effectively support real-world medical applications and clinical decision-making.
