{"abstract":"As technologies advent, attention should be given to raise awareness for implementing Artificial Intelligence in health care. Evidence supporting this view has largely acquired through the use of Clinical Decision Support Systems, which assist medical professionals with knowledge that enhance the well-being of their patients. Nevertheless, the capacity and power of CDSSs has not been fully unlocked. Knowledge Graph provides standardized representation and structural integration that are the key components in building an auxiliary diagnosis system, and reasoning upon knowledge graph unleash the application's potential. Our paper here hopes to serve as a basis for future research concerning knowledge graph-based Clinical Decision Support Systems."}
