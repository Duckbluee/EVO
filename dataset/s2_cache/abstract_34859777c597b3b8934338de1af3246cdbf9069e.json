{"abstract":"Edge computing has been getting a momentum with ever-increasing data at the edge of the network. In particular, huge amounts of video data and their real-time processing requirements have been increasingly hindering the traditional cloud computing approach due to high bandwidth consumption and high latency. Edge computing in essence aims to overcome this hindrance by processing most video data making use of edge servers, such as small-scale on-premises server clusters, server-grade computing resources at mobile base stations and even mobile devices like smartphones and tablets; hence, the term edge-based video analytics. However, the actual realization of such analytics requires more than the simple, collective use of edge servers. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art works on edge-based video analytics with respect to applications, architectures, techniques, resource management, security and privacy. We provide a comprehensive and detailed review on what works, what doesn't work and why. These findings give insights and suggestions for next generation edge-based video analytics. We also identify open issues and research directions."}
