{"abstract":"Privacy-preserving computing is crucial for multi-center machine learning in many applications such as healthcare and finance. In this paper a Multi-center Privacy Computing framework with Predictions Aggregation (MPCPA) based on denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is proposed, in which conditional diffusion model training, DDPM data generation, a classifier, and strategy of prediction aggregation are included. Compared to federated learning, this framework necessitates fewer communications and leverages high-quality generated data to support robust privacy computing. Experimental validation across multiple datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework outperforms classic federated learning and approaches the performance of centralized learning with original data. Moreover, our approach demonstrates robust security, effectively addressing challenges such as image memorization and membership inference attacks. Our experiments underscore the efficacy of the proposed framework in the realm of privacy computing, with the code set to be released soon."}
