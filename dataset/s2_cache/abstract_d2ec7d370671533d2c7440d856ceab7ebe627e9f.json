{"abstract":"A smart grid is a typical cyber-physical system (CPS). Cyber networks and physical networks of smart grids have similar topologies and interdependent characteristics, which may induce cyber-physical coupling failures. Remedial control for physical outages may fail due to a simultaneous cyber-side failure, thereby increasing the risk to smart grids. To improve the robustness of smart grids in the face of possible cyber-physical coupling failures, the critical information flow should be allocated to reliable paths to ensure accessibility. The existing routing for power communication networks follows the information flow fairness principle. However, the information flow has different levels of importance in different power system states. In this paper, an importance evaluation approach for information flow based on the cyber-physical sensitivity is introduced. Then, a CPS robust routing model (CPS-RRM) with a priority mechanism that considers cyber-physical disturbances is proposed based on robust optimization. The formulated CPS-RRM is converted to a linear problem using the Big-M method and is solved using a modified C-CG algorithm. The superiority of our model is validated by comparing it to conventional routing based on the shortest-path model in terms of robustness and performance in power flow corrective control."}
