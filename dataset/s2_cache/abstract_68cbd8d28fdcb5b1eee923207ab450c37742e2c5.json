{"abstract":"This work is aimed at the experimental studying the influence of local data characteristics and drifts on the difficulties of learning various online classifiers from multi-class imbalanced data streams. Firstly we present a categorization of these data factors and drifts in the context of imbalanced streams, then we introduce the generators of synthetic streams that model these factors and drifts. The results of many experiments with synthetically generated data streams have shown a much greater role of the overlapping between many minority classes (the type of borderline examples) than for streams with one minority class. The presence of rare examples in the stream is the most difficult single factor. The local drift of splitting minority classes is the third influential factor. Unlike binary streams, the specialized UOB and OOB classifiers perform well enough for even high imbalance ratios. The most challenging for all classifiers are complex scenarios integrating the drifts of the identified factors simultaneously, which worsen the evaluation measures in the case of a several minority classes stronger than for binary ones. This is an extended version of the short paper presented at LIDTA'2022 workshop at ECMLPKDD2022."}
