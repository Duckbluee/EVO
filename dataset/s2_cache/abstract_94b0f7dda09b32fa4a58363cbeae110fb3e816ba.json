{"abstract":"Abstract The security field is always evolving. This, given the turbulent world in which we all live, requires the security professional to remain fluid in adjusting protective strategies to protect employees, property, assets, and revenue of the business enterprise. The future of the security industry is bright and it can be lucrative for the professional who is well rounded and has acquired the necessary skill sets, including formal education, certifications, and a complement of international experience and exposure. Global incident management, which directly supports the resiliency of the business enterprise, has never been more important, as multinationals continue to grow globally. Protecting the homeland will also require a greater burden on private security industry resources over the next decade."}
