{"abstract":"The Joint Automated Repository for Various Integrated Simulations (JARVIS) is an integrated infrastructure to accelerate materials discovery and design using density functional theory (DFT), classical force-fields (FF), and machine learning (ML) techniques. JARVIS is motivated by the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) principles of developing open-access databases and tools to reduce the cost and development time of materials discovery, optimization, and deployment. The major features of JARVIS are: JARVIS-DFT, JARVIS-FF, JARVIS-ML, and JARVIS-Tools. To date, JARVIS consists of ~ 40,000 materials and ~ 1 million calculated properties in JARVIS-DFT, ~ 1,500 materials and ~ 110 force-fields in JARVIS-FF, and ~ 25 ML models for material-property predictions in JARVIS-ML, all of which are continuously expanding. JARVIS-Tools provides scripts and workflows for running and analyzing various simulations. We compare our computational data to experiments or high-fidelity computational methods wherever applicable to evaluate error/uncertainty in predictions. In addition to the existing workflows, the infrastructure can support a wide variety of other technologically important applications as part of the data-driven materials design paradigm. The databases and tools are publicly distributed through the following major websites this http URL and this https URL ."}
