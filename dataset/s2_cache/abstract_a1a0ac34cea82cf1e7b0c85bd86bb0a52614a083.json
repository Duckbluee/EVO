{"abstract":"Multimodal recommendation system has been widely used in short video platform, e-commerce platform and news media. Multimodal data contains information such as product image and product text, which is often used as auxiliary signal to improve the effect of recommendation system significantly. In order to alleviate the problems of data sparsity and noise, some researchers construct data augmentation to use self-supervised learning to help model training. These methods have achieved certain results. However, most of the work is based on data augmentation in random ways, such as random masking and random perturbation. This random method is likely to lose important information and introduce new noise, resulting in biased augmentation data. Therefore, we propose a Modal-aware Bias Constrained Contrastive Learning method (BCCL) to solve the above problems. Specifically, BCCL introduces a bias-constrained data augmentation method to ensure the quality of augmentation samples. Then the multi-modal semantic information is modeled by the designed modal awareness module. Furthermore, we propose a information alignment module to improve the sparse modal feature learning of the model. We conducted a comprehensive experiment on three real-world data sets, and the experimental results showed that the proposed BCCL outperformed all the state-of-art methods. In-depth experiments have verified the effectiveness of our proposed modules."}
