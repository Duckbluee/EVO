{"abstract":"An emerging trend in utilizing service robots in a vast range of application areas could be seen nowadays as a promising effort to uplift the living standard. These service robots are intended to be used by non-expert users, and their service tasks often require navigation in human-populated environments. Thus, human-friendly navigation behavior is expected from these robots by users. A service robot should be aware of Human–Robot Proxemics (HRP) to facilitate human-friendly navigation behavior. This paper presents a review on HRP. Both user studies conducted for exploring HRP preferences and methods developed toward establishing HRP awareness in service robots are considered within the scope of the review. The available literature has been scrutinized to identify the limitations of state of the art and potential future work. Furthermore, important HRP parameters and behavior revealed by the existing user studies are summarized under one roof to smooth the availability of data required for developing HRP-aware behavior in service robots."}
