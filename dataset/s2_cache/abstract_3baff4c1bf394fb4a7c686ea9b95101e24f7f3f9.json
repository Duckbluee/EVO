{"abstract":"Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a foundation model for semantic segmentation and shows excellent generalization capability with the prompts. In this empirical study, we investigate the robustness and zero-shot generalizability of the SAM in the domain of robotic surgery in various settings of (i) prompted vs. unprompted; (ii) bounding box vs. points-based prompt; (iii) generalization under corruptions and perturbations with five severity levels; and (iv) state-of-the-art supervised model vs. SAM. We conduct all the observations with two well-known robotic instrument segmentation datasets of MICCAI EndoVis 2017 and 2018 challenges. Our extensive evaluation results reveal that although SAM shows remarkable zero-shot generalization ability with bounding box prompts, it struggles to segment the whole instrument with point-based prompts and unprompted settings. Furthermore, our qualitative figures demonstrate that the model either failed to predict the parts of the instrument mask (e.g., jaws, wrist) or predicted parts of the instrument as different classes in the scenario of overlapping instruments within the same bounding box or with the point-based prompt. In fact, it is unable to identify instruments in some complex surgical scenarios of blood, reflection, blur, and shade. Additionally, SAM is insufficiently robust to maintain high performance when subjected to various forms of data corruption. Therefore, we can argue that SAM is not ready for downstream surgical tasks without further domain-specific fine-tuning."}
