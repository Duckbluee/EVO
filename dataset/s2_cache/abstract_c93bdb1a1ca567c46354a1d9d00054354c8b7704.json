{"abstract":"With the emergence of increasingly powerful large language models, there is a burgeoning interest in leveraging these models for casual conversation and role-play applications. However, existing conversational and role-playing datasets often fail to capture the diverse and nuanced interactions typically exhibited by real-world role-play participants. To address this limitation and contribute to the rapidly growing field, we introduce a partially-synthetic dataset named PIPPA (Personal Interaction Pairs between People and AI). PIPPA is a result of a community-driven crowdsourcing effort involving a group of role-play enthusiasts. The dataset comprises over 1 million utterances that are distributed across 26,000 conversation sessions and provides a rich resource for researchers and AI developers to explore and refine conversational AI systems in the context of role-play scenarios."}
