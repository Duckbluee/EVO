{"abstract":"This paper presents a comprehensive examination of how multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are paving the way towards the realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in educational contexts. It scrutinizes the evolution and integration of AI in educational systems, emphasizing the crucial role of multimodality, which encompasses auditory, visual, kinesthetic, and linguistic modes of learning. This research delves deeply into the key facets of AGI, including cognitive frameworks, advanced knowledge representation, adaptive learning mechanisms, strategic planning, sophisticated language processing, and the integration of diverse multimodal data sources. It critically assesses AGI's transformative potential in reshaping educational paradigms, focusing on enhancing teaching and learning effectiveness, filling gaps in existing methodologies, and addressing ethical considerations and responsible usage of AGI in educational settings. The paper also discusses the implications of multimodal AI's role in education, offering insights into future directions and challenges in AGI development. This exploration aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the intersection between AI, multimodality, and education, setting a foundation for future research and development in AGI."}
