{"abstract":"In this paper we describe a classification method that allows the use of graph-based representations of data instead of traditional vector-based representations. We compare the vector approach combined with the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm to the graph-matching approach when classifying three different web document collections, using the leave-one-out approach for measuring classification accuracy. We also compare the performance of different graph distance measures as well as various document representations that utilize graphs. The results show the graph-based approach can outperform traditional vector-based methods in terms of accuracy, dimensionality and execution time."}
