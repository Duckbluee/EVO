{"abstract":"This study is related to human-aware navigation (HAN) of a robot moving in a 2D plane. During the navigation process, the robot first finds a global path given start and goal points and it also dynamically scans the environment for possible new obstacles and rearranges its path plan as to those encountered ones. It is well-known fact that treating humans as an ordinary object by robots while passing them leads to humans feeling stressed since the actions of robots still are not explicit for them. For this reason, besides planning strategy secondly, it is also considered whether obstacles are human or non-human ones via the improved algorithm. By doing so, it is aimed for the robot to navigate in an environment considering human comfort. To examine this intention, two different path planning algorithms improved by dynamically classical and human obstacles aware scheme are tested on a home-like environment. According to the results, it has been observed that the robot dynamically plans its navigation framework given target points and new obstacles. Furthermore, it successfully achieves to keep distance from human obstacles based on the proxemics theory distance requirements."}
