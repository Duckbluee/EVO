{"abstract":"Recommender systems are indispensable in the realm of online applications, and sequential recommendation has enjoyed considerable prevalence due to its capacity to encapsulate the dynamic shifts in user interests. However, previous sequential modeling methods still have limitations in capturing contextual information. The primary reason is the lack of understanding of domain-specific knowledge and item-related textual content. Fortunately, the emergence of powerful language models has unlocked the potential to incorporate extensive world knowledge into recommendation algorithms, enabling them to go beyond simple item attributes and truly understand the world surrounding user preferences. To achieve this, we propose LANCER, which leverages the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained language models to generate personalized recommendations. Our approach bridges the gap between language models and recommender systems, resulting in more human-like recommendations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a series of experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets, showing promising results and providing valuable insights into the influence of our model on sequential recommendation tasks. Furthermore, our experimental codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Gnimixy/lancer."}
