{"abstract":"Current Intellectual Property (IP) copyright protection technologies have low efficiency of authority management, traceability, and scalability. In this work, a blockchain-based IP copyright protection algorithm is proposed to address these issues by establishing a mathematical model of quadratic matrix transformation for IP circuit trading. This algorithm proposes the design of a distributed random embedding mechanism and position mapping function that, when IP trading occurs in blockchain, the traceable mapping function can trace the copyright information in IP trading with the mapping factor. Besides, this work analyzes the credibility, transparency, overhead, and complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can resist replaying attacks, yet the copyright information can be rapidly retrieved after suffered from attacks. Still, the proposed algorithm has higher security, stability, and traceability."}
