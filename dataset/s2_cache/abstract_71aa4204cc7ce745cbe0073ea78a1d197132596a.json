{"abstract":"Sequential recommendation systems aim to predict users’ next likely interaction based on their history. However, these systems face data sparsity and cold-start problems. Utilizing data from other domains, known as multi-domain methods, is useful for alleviating these problems. However, traditional multi-domain methods rely on meaningless ID-based item representation, which makes it difficult to align items with similar meanings from different domains, yielding sup-optimal knowledge transfer. This article introduces LLM-Rec, a framework that utilizes pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for domain-agnostic recommendation. Specifically, we mix user’s behaviors from multiple domains and concatenate item titles into a sentence, then use LLMs for generating user and item representations. By mixing behaviors across different domains, we can exploit the knowledge encoded in LLMs to bridge the semantic across over multi-domain behaviors, thus obtaining semantically rich representations and improving performance in all domains. Furthermore, we explore the underlying reasons why LLMs are effective and investigate whether LLMs can understand the semantic correlations as the recommendation model, and if advanced techniques like scaling laws in NLP also work in recommendations. We conduct extensive experiments with LLMs ranging from 40 M to 6.7 B to answer the above questions and to verify the effectiveness of LLM-Rec in multi-domain recommendation.
