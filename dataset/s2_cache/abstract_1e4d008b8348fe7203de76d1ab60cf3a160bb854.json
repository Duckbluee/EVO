{"abstract":"Main challenges in long-tailed recognition come from the imbalanced data distribution and sample scarcity in its tail classes. While techniques have been proposed to achieve a more balanced training loss and to improve tail classes data variations with synthesized samples, we resort to leverage readily available unlabeled data to boost recognition accuracy. The idea leads to a new recognition setting, namely semi-supervised long-tailed recognition. We argue this setting better resembles the real-world data collection and annotation process and hence can help close the gap to real-world scenarios. To address the semi-supervised long-tailed recognition problem, we present an alternate sampling framework combining the intuitions from successful methods in these two research areas. The classifier and feature embedding are learned separately and updated iteratively. The class-balanced sampling strategy has been implemented to train the classifier in a way not affected by the pseudo labels' quality on the unlabeled data. A consistency loss has been introduced to limit the impact from unlabeled data while leveraging them to update the feature embedding. We demonstrate significant accuracy improvements over other competitive methods on two datasets."}
