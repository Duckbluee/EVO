{"abstract":"Due to the abundant neurophysiological information in the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal, EEG signals integrated with deep learning methods have gained substantial traction across numerous real-world tasks. However, the development of supervised learning methods based on EEG signals has been hindered by the high cost and significant label discrepancies to manually label large-scale EEG datasets. Self-supervised frameworks are adopted in vision and language fields to solve this issue, but the lack of EEG-specific theoretical foundations hampers their applicability across various tasks. To solve these challenges, this paper proposes a knowledge-driven cross-view contrastive learning framework (KDC2), which integrates neurological theory to extract effective representations from EEG with limited labels. The KDC2 method creates scalp and neural views of EEG signals, simulating the internal and external representation of brain activity. Sequentially, inter-view and cross-view contrastive learning pipelines in combination with various augmentation methods are applied to capture neural features from different views. By modeling prior neural knowledge based on homologous neural information consistency theory, the proposed method extracts invariant and complementary neural knowledge to generate combined representations. Experimental results on different downstream tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the superior generalization of neural knowledge-supported EEG representations across various brain tasks."}
