{"abstract":"Jointly utilizing multiple GPUs to train graph neural networks (GNNs) is crucial for handling large graphs and achieving high efficiency. However, we find that existing systems suffer from high communication costs and low GPU utilization due to improper data layout and training procedures. Thus, we propose a system dubbed Distributed Sampling and Pipelining (DSP) for multi-GPU GNN training. DSP adopts a tailored data layout to utilize the fast NVLink connections among the GPUs, which stores the graph topology and popular node features in GPU memory. For efficient graph sampling with multiple GPUs, we introduce a collective sampling primitive (CSP), which pushes the sampling tasks to data to reduce communication. We also design a producer-consumer-based pipeline, which allows tasks from different mini-batches to run congruently to improve GPU utilization. We compare DSP with state-of-the-art GNN training frameworks, and the results show that DSP consistently outperforms the baselines under different datasets, GNN models and GPU counts. The speedup of DSP can be up to 26x and is over 2x in most cases."}
