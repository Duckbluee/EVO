{"abstract":"In this paper, we present RoCC, a robust congestion control approach for datacenter networks based on RDMA. RoCC leverages switch queue size as an input to a PI controller, which computes the fair data rate of flows in the queue, signaling it to the flow sources. The PI parameters are self-tuning to guarantee stability, rapid convergence, and fair and near-optimal throughput in a wide range of congestion scenarios. Our simulation and DPDK implementation results show that RoCC can achieve up to 7× reduction in PFC frames generated under high average load levels, compared to DCQCN. At the same time, RoCC can achieve up to 8× lower tail latency, compared to DCQCN and HPCC. We also find that RoCC does not require PFC. The functional components of RoCC are implementable in P4-based and fixed-function switch ASICs."}
