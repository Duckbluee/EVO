{"abstract":"Clustered federated learning (CFL) is proposed to mitigate the performance deterioration stemming from data heterogeneity in federated learning (FL) by grouping similar clients for cluster-wise model training. However, current CFL methods struggle due to inadequate integration of global and intra-cluster knowledge and the absence of an efficient online model similarity metric, while treating the cluster count as a fixed hyperparameter limits flexibility and robustness. In this paper, we propose an adaptive CFL framework, named FedAC, which (1) efficiently integrates global knowledge into intra-cluster learning by decoupling neural networks and utilizing distinct aggregation methods for each submodule, significantly enhancing performance; (2) includes a costeffective online model similarity metric based on dimensionality reduction; (3) incorporates a cluster number fine-tuning module for improved adaptability and scalability in complex, heterogeneous environments. Extensive experiments show that FedAC achieves superior empirical performance, increasing the test accuracy by around 1.82% and 12.67% on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, respectively, under different non-IID settings compared to SOTA methods."}
