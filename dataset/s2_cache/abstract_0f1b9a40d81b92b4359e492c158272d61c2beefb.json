{"abstract":"This lecture covers several basic methods for standard tasks in data analysis and image processing. A non-exclusive and non-exhaustive list of meth-ods: histograms, dimension reduction, clustering, ﬁlters, frequency analysis, morphological methods. . . We will develop the mathematical theory that underlies these methods which is the basis for thorough understanding and proper execution of the method. Moreover, we will deal with the practical implementation of the methods and apply them to solve problems such as image denoising, image deblurring, or music identiﬁcation. This lecture should enable you to take a deeper dive into image and data analysis and prepares you to follow recent developments in the ﬁeld. If you want to understand the inner working of image compression with JPEG or music recognition with tools like Shazam, come to this lecture!"}
