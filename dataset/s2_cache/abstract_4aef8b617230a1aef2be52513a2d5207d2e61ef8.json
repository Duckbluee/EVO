{"abstract":"As novel connections between heterogenous systems becomes the norm, and these self-integrated systems aspire to being robust enough to incorporate previously-isolated entities with varying degrees of natural and artificial intelligence, we would do well to re-examine our foundational assumptions about the models of the human brain upon which our AIs are based. This position paper proposes that the human brain is actually a small, network of heterogenous processors. We further propose that the manner in which mature humans integrate these processors, both individually and in cooperation with others, may provide valuable insights into possible paths forward in the development of systems of systems that can learn how to improve themselves and the ways in which they integrate with others."}
