{"abstract":"We consider the average consensus problem for the multi‐agent system in the discrete‐time domain. Three triggering based control protocols are developed, which dictate the broadcast and control update instants of individual agents to alleviate communication and computational burden. Lyapunov‐based design methods prescribe when agents should communicate and update their control so that the network converges to the average of agents' initial states. We start with a static version of the distributed event‐triggering law and then generalize it so that it involves an internal auxiliary variable to regulate the threshold dynamically for each agent. The third protocol uses a self‐triggering algorithm to avoid continuous listening wherein each agent estimates its next triggering time and broadcasts it to its neighbors at the current triggering time. Numerical simulations are shown to validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms."}
