{"abstract":"Autonomous 3D part assembly is a challenging task in the areas of robotics and 3D computer vision. This task aims to assemble individual components into a complete shape without relying on predefined instructions. In this paper, we formulate this task from a novel generative perspective, introducing the Score-based 3D Part Assembly framework (Score-PA) for 3D part assembly. Knowing that score-based methods are typically time-consuming during the inference stage. To address this issue, we introduce a novel algorithm called the Fast Predictor-Corrector Sampler (FPC) that accelerates the sampling process within the framework. We employ various metrics to assess assembly quality and diversity, and our evaluation results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. We release our code at https://github.com/J-F-Cheng/Score-PA_Score-based-3D-Part-Assembly."}
