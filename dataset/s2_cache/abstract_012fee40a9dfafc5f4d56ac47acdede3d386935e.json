{"abstract":"This article is concerned with the influence maximization (IM) problem under a network with probabilistically unstable links (PULs) via graph embedding for multiagent systems (MASs). First, two diffusion models, the unstable-link independent cascade (UIC) model and the unstable-link linear threshold (ULT) model, are designed for the IM problem under the network with PULs. Second, the MAS model for the IM problem with PULs is established and a series of interaction rules among agents are built for the MAS model. Third, the similarity of the unstable structure of the nodes is defined and a novel graph embedding method, termed the unstable-similarity2vec (US2vec) approach, is proposed to tackle the IM problem under the network with PULs. According to the embedding results of the US2vec approach, the seed set is figured out by the developed algorithm. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to: 1) verify the validity of the proposed model and the developed algorithms and 2) illustrate the optimal solution for IM under different scenarios with PULs."}
