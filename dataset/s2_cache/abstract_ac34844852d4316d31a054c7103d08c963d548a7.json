{"abstract":"With the popularity of dual cameras in recently released smart phones, a growing number of super-resolution (SR) methods have been proposed to enhance the resolution of stereo image pairs. However, the lack of high-quality stereo datasets has limited the research in this area. To facilitate the training and evaluation of novel stereo SR algorithms, in this paper, we present a large-scale stereo dataset named Flickr1024, which contains 1024 pairs of high-quality images and covers diverse scenarios. We first introduce the data acquisition and processing pipeline, and then compare several popular stereo datasets. Finally, we conduct cross-dataset experiments to investigate the potential benefits introduced by our dataset. Experimental results show that, as compared to the KITTI and Middlebury datasets, our Flickr1024 dataset can help to handle the over-fitting problem and significantly improves the performance of stereo SR methods. The Flickr1024 dataset is available online at: https://yingqianwang.github.io/Flickr1024."}
