{"abstract":"The advancement of deep learning has led to the emergence of Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) models, known for their dynamic allocation of computational resources based on input. Despite their promise, MoEs face challenges, particularly in terms of memory requirements. To address this, our work introduces SEER-MoE, a novel two-stage framework for reducing both the memory footprint and compute requirements of pre-trained MoE models. The first stage involves pruning the total number of experts using a heavy-hitters counting guidance, while the second stage employs a regularization-based fine-tuning strategy to recover accuracy loss and reduce the number of activated experts during inference. Our empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, resulting in a sparse MoEs model optimized for inference efficiency with minimal accuracy trade-offs."}
