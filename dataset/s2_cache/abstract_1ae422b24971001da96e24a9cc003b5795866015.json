{"abstract":"Advancements in AI-synthesized human voices have created a growing threat of impersonation and disinformation, making it crucial to develop methods to detect synthetic human voices. This study proposes a new approach to identifying synthetic human voices by detecting artifacts of vocoders in audio signals. Most DeepFake audio synthesis models use a neural vocoder, a neural network that generates waveforms from temporal-frequency representations like mel-spectrograms. By identifying neural vocoder processing in audio, we can determine if a sample is synthesized. To detect synthetic human voices, we introduce a multi-task learning framework for a binaryclass RawNet2 model that shares the feature extractor with a vocoder identification module. By treating vocoder identification as a pretext task, we constrain the feature extractor to focus on vocoder artifacts and provide discriminative features for the final binary classifier. Our experiments show that the improved RawNet2 model based on vocoder identification achieves high classification performance on the binary task overall.
