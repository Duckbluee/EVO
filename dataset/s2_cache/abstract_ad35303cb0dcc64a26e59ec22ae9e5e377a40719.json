{"abstract":"The privacy-preserving federated learning for vertically partitioned data has shown promising results as the solution of the emerging multi-party joint modeling application, in which the data holders (such as government branches, private finance and e-business companies) collaborate throughout the learning process rather than relying on a trusted third party to hold data. However, existing federated learning algorithms for vertically partitioned data are limited to synchronous computation. To improve the efficiency when the unbalanced computation/communication resources are common among the parties in the federated learning system, it is essential to develop asynchronous training algorithms for vertically partitioned data while keeping the data privacy. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous federated SGD (AFSGD-VP) algorithm and its SVRG and SAGA variants on the vertically partitioned data. Moreover, we provide the convergence analyses of AFSGD-VP and its SVRG and SAGA variants under the condition of strong convexity. We also discuss their model privacy, data privacy, computational complexities and communication costs. To the best of our knowledge, AFSGD-VP and its SVRG and SAGA variants are the first asynchronous federated learning algorithms for vertically partitioned data. Extensive experimental results on a variety of vertically partitioned datasets not only verify the theoretical results of AFSGD-VP and its SVRG and SAGA variants, but also show that our algorithms have much higher efficiency than the corresponding synchronous algorithms."}
