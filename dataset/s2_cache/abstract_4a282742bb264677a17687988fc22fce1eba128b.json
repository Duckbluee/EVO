{"abstract":"The key problem in multivariate time series (MTS) analysis and forecasting aims to disclose the underlying couplings between variables that drive the co-movements. Considerable recent successful MTS methods are built with graph neural networks (GNNs) due to their essential capacity for relational modeling. However, previous work often used a static graph structure of time-series variables for modeling MTS failing to capture their ever-changing correlations over time. To this end, a fully-connected supra-graph connecting any two variables at any two timestamps is adaptively learned to capture the high-resolution variable dependencies via an efficient graph convolutional network. Specifically, we construct the Edge-Varying Fourier Graph Networks (EV-FGN) equipped with Fourier Graph Shift Operator (FGSO) which efficiently performs graph convolution in the frequency domain. As a result, a high-efficiency scale-free parameter learning scheme is derived for MTS analysis and forecasting according to the convolution theorem. Extensive experiments show that EV-FGN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on seven real-world MTS datasets."}
