{"abstract":"Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a potent paradigm for self-supervised graph learning that has attracted attention across various application scenarios. However, GCL for learning on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) has yet to be explored. Because conventional augmentation techniques like feature embedding masking cannot directly process textual attributes on TAGs. A naive strategy for applying GCL to TAGs is to encode the textual attributes into feature embeddings via a language model and then feed the embeddings into the following GCL module for processing. Such a strategy faces three key challenges: I) failure to avoid information loss, II) semantic loss during the text encoding phase, and III) implicit augmentation constraints that lead to uncontrollable and incomprehensible results. In this paper, we propose a novel GCL framework named LATEX-GCL to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce textual augmentations and LLMs' powerful natural language processing (NLP) abilities to address the three limitations aforementioned to pave the way for applying GCL to TAG tasks. Extensive experiments on four high-quality TAG datasets illustrate the superiority of the proposed LATEX-GCL method.
