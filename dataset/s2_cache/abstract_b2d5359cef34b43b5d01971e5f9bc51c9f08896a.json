{"abstract":"With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), many kinds of wireless signals (e.g., Wi-Fi, LoRa, RFID) are filling our living and working spaces nowadays. Beyond communication, wireless signals can sense the status of surrounding objects, known as wireless sensing, with their reflection, scattering, and refraction while propagating in space. In the last decade, many sophisticated wireless sensing techniques and systems were widely studied for various applications (e.g., gesture recognition, localization, and object imaging). Recently, deep Artificial Intelligence (AI), also known as Deep Learning (DL), has shown great success in computer vision. And some works have initially proved that deep AI can benefit wireless sensing as well, leading to a brand-new step toward ubiquitous sensing. In this survey, we focus on the evolution of wireless sensing enhanced by deep AI techniques. We first present a general workflow of Wireless Sensing Systems (WSSs) which consists of signal pre-processing, high-level feature, and sensing model formulation. For each module, existing deep AI-based techniques are summarized, further compared with traditional approaches. Then, we provide a view of issues and challenges induced by combining deep AI and wireless sensing together. Finally, we discuss the future trends of deep AI to enable ubiquitous wireless sensing."}
