{"abstract":"The Activity Recognition Chain generally precludes the challenging scenario of recognizing new activities that were unseen during training, despite this scenario being a practical and common one as users perform diverse activities at test time. A few prior works have adopted zero-shot learning methods for IMU-based activity recognition, which work by relating seen and unseen classes through an auxiliary semantic space. However, these methods usually rely heavily on a hand-crafted attribute space which is costly to define, or a learnt semantic space based on word embedding, which lacks motion-related information crucial for distinguishing IMU features. Instead, we propose a strategy to exploit videos of human activities to construct an informative semantic space. With our approach, knowledge from state-of-the-art video action recognition models is encoded into video embeddings to relate seen and unseen activity classes. Experiments on three public datasets find that our approach outperforms other learnt semantic spaces, with an additional desirable feature of scalability, as recognition performance is seen to scale with the amount of data used. More generally, our results indicate that exploiting information from the video domain for IMU-based tasks is a promising direction, with tangible returns in a zero-shot learning scenario."}
