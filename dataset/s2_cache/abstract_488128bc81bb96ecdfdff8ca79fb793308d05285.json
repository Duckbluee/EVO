{"abstract":"Data-parallel training is widely used for scaling DNN training over large datasets, using the parameter server or all-reduce architecture. Communication scheduling has been promising to accelerate distributed DNN training, which aims to overlap communication with computation by scheduling the order of communication operations. We identify two limitations of previous communication scheduling work. First, layer-wise computation graph has been a common assumption, while modern machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow) use a sophisticated directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation as the execution model. Second, the default sizes of tensors are often less than optimal for transmission scheduling and bandwidth utilization. We propose PACE, a communication scheduler that preemptively schedules (potentially fused) all-reduce tensors based on the DAG of DNN training, guaranteeing maximal overlapping of communication with computation and high bandwidth utilization. The scheduler contains two integrated modules: given a DAG, we identify the best tensor-preemptive communication schedule that minimizes the training time; exploiting the optimal communication scheduling as an oracle, a dynamic programming approach is developed for generating a good DAG, which merges small communication tensors for efficient bandwidth utilization. Experiments in a GPU testbed show that PACE accelerates training with representative system configurations, achieving up to 36% speed-up compared with state-of-the-art solutions."}
