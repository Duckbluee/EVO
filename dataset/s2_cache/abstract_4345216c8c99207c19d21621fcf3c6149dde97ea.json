{"abstract":"ID-based Recommender Systems (RecSys), where each item is assigned a unique identifier and subsequently converted into an embedding vector, have dominated the de-signing of RecSys. Though prevalent, such ID-based paradigm is not suitable for developing transferable RecSys and is also susceptible to the cold -start issue. In this paper, we unleash the boundaries of the ID- based paradigm and propose a Pure Multi-Modality based Recommender system (PMMRec), which relies solely on the multi-modal contents of the items (e.g., texts and images) and learns transition patterns general enough to transfer across domains and platforms. Specifically, we design a plug-and-play framework architecture consisting of multi-modal item encoders, a fusion module, and a user encoder. To align the cross-modal item representations, we propose a novel next-item enhanced cross-modal contrastive learning objective, which is equipped with both inter- and intra-modality negative samples and explicitly incorporates the transition patterns of user behaviors into the item encoders. To ensure the robustness of user representations, we propose a novel noised item detection objective and a robustness-aware contrastive learning objective, which work together to denoise user sequences in a self-supervised manner. PMMRec is designed to be loosely coupled, so after being pre-trained on the source data, each component can be transferred alone, or in conjunction with other components, allowing PMMRec to achieve versatility under both multi-modality and single-modality transfer learning settings. Extensive experiments on 4 sources and 10 target datasets demonstrate that PMMRec surpasses the state-of-the-art recommenders in both recommendation performance and transferability.
