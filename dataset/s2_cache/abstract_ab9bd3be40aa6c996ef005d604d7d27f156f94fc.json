{"abstract":"Neural network models have demonstrated outstanding performance in a variety of applications, from image classification to natural language processing. However, deploying the models to hardware raises efficiency and reliability issues. From the efficiency perspective, the storage, computation, and communication cost of neural network processing is considerably large because the neural network models have a large number of parameters and operations. From the standpoint of robustness, the perturbation in hardware is unavoidable and thus the performance of neural networks can be degraded. As a result, this paper investigates effective learning and optimization approaches as well as advanced hardware designs in order to build efficient and robust neural network designs."}
