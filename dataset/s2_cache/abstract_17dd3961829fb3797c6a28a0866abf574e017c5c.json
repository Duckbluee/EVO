{"abstract":"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DeepRL) agents surpass human-level performances in a multitude of tasks. However, the direct mapping from states to actions makes it hard to interpret the rationale behind the decision making of agents. In contrast to previous a-posteriori methods of visualizing DeepRL policies, we propose an end-to-end trainable framework based on Rainbow, a representative Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent. Our method automatically learns important regions in the input domain, which enables characterizations of the decision making and interpretations for non-intuitive behaviors. Hence we name it Region Sensitive Rainbow (RS-Rainbow). RS-Rainbow utilizes a simple yet effective mechanism to incorporate visualization ability into the learning model, not only improving model interpretability, but leading to improved performance. Extensive experiments on the challenging platform of Atari 2600 demonstrate the superiority of RS-Rainbow. In particular, our agent achieves state of the art at just 25% of the training frames.
