{"abstract":"This paper presents a study on the development of an obstacle-avoidance navigation system for autonomous navigation in home environments. The system utilizes vision-based techniques and advanced path-planning algorithms to enable the robot to navigate toward the destination while avoiding obstacles. The performance of the system is evaluated through qualitative and quantitative metrics, highlighting its strengths and limitations. The findings contribute to the advancement of indoor robot navigation, showcasing the potential of vision-based techniques for real-time, autonomous navigation."}
