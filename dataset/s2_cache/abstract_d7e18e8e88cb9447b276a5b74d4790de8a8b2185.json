{"abstract":"To handle the issue of preventing emergencies for motion planning in autonomous driving, we present a novel parallel motion planning framework. Artificial traffic scenes are firstly constructed based on real traffic scenes. A deep planning model which can learn from both real and artificial scenes is developed and used to make planning decisions in an end-to-end mode. To prevent emergencies, a generative adversarial networks (GAN) model is designed and learns from the artificial emergencies from artificial traffic scenes. During deployment, the well-trained GAN model is used to generate multiple virtual emergencies based on the current real scene, and the well-trained planning model simultaneously makes different planning decisions for both virtual scenes and the current scenes. The final planning decision is made by comprehensively analyzing observations and virtual emergencies. Through parallel planning, the planner can timely make rational decision without a large number of calculations when an emergency occurs."}
