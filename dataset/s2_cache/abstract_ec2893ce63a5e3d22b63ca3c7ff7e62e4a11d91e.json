{"abstract":"The perceptual system design for humanoid robots poses unique challenges due to inherent structural constraints that cause severe self-occlusion and limited field-of-view (FOV). We present HumanoidPano, a novel hybrid cross-modal perception framework that synergistically integrates panoramic vision and LiDAR sensing to overcome these limitations. Unlike conventional robot perception systems that rely on monocular cameras or standard multi-sensor configurations, our method establishes geometrically-aware modality alignment through a spherical vision transformer, enabling seamless fusion of 360 visual context with LiDAR's precise depth measurements. First, Spherical Geometry-aware Constraints (SGC) leverage panoramic camera ray properties to guide distortion-regularized sampling offsets for geometric alignment. Second, Spatial Deformable Attention (SDA) aggregates hierarchical 3D features via spherical offsets, enabling efficient 360{\\deg}-to-BEV fusion with geometrically complete object representations. Third, Panoramic Augmentation (AUG) combines cross-view transformations and semantic alignment to enhance BEV-panoramic feature consistency during data augmentation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the 360BEV-Matterport benchmark. Real-world deployment on humanoid platforms validates the system's capability to generate accurate BEV segmentation maps through panoramic-LiDAR co-perception, directly enabling downstream navigation tasks in complex environments. Our work establishes a new paradigm for embodied perception in humanoid robotics."}
