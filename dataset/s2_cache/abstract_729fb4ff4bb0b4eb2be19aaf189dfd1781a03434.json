{"abstract":"Logs are one of the most valuable data sources for managing large-scale online services. After a failure is detected/diagnosed/predicted, operators still have to inspect the raw logs to gain a summarized view before take actions. However, manual or rule-based log summarization has become inefficient and ineffective. In this work, we propose LogSummary, an automatic, unsupervised end-to-end log summarization framework for online services. LogSummary obtains the summarized triples of important logs for a given log sequence. It integrates a novel information extraction method taking both semantic information and domain knowledge into consideration, with a new triple ranking approach using the global knowledge learned from all logs. Given the lack of a publicly-available gold standard for log summarization, we have manually labelled the summaries of four open-source log datasets and made them publicly available. The evaluation on these datasets as well as the case studies on real-world logs demonstrate that LogSummary produces a highly representative (average ROUGE F1 score of 0.741) summaries. We have packaged LogSummary into an open-source toolkit and hope that it can benefit for future NLP-powered summarization works."}
