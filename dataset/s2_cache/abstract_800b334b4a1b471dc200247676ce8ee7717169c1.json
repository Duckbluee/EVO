{"abstract":"The problem of different training and test set class priors is addressed in the context of CNN classifiers. We compare two approaches to the estimation of the unknown test priors: an existing Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method and a proposed Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) approach introducing a Dirichlet hyper-prior on the class prior probabilities. Experimental results show a significant improvement in the fine-grained classification tasks using known evaluation-time priors, increasing top-1 accuracy by 4.0% on the FGVC iNaturalist 2018 validation set and by 3.9% on the FGVCx Fungi 2018 validation set. Estimation of the unknown test set priors noticeably increases the accuracy on the PlantCLEF dataset, allowing a single CNN model to achieve state-of-the-art results and to outperform the competition-winning ensemble of 12 CNNs. The proposed MAP estimation increases the prediction accuracy by 2.8% on PlantCLEF 2017 and by 1.8% on FGVCx Fungi, where the MLE method decreases accuracy."}
