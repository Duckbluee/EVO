{"abstract":"This paper presents a transformer-based Siamese network architecture (abbreviated by ChangeFormer) for Change Detection (CD) from a pair of co-registered remote sensing images. Different from recent CD frameworks, which are based on fully convolutional networks (ConvNets), the proposed method unifies hierarchically structured transformer encoder with Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) decoder in a Siamese network architecture to efficiently render multi-scale long-range details required for accurate CD. Experiments on two CD datasets show that the proposed end-to-end trainable ChangeFormer architecture achieves better CD performance than previous counterparts. Our code and pre-trained models are available at github.com/wgcban/ChangeFormer."}
