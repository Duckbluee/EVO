{"abstract":"In order to preserve data privacy while fully utilizing data from different owners, federated learning is believed to be a promising approach in recent years. However, aiming at federated learning in the image domain, gradient inversion techniques can reconstruct the input images on pixel-level only by leaked gradients, without accessing the raw data, which makes federated learning vulnerable to the attacks. In this paper, we review the latest advances of image gradient inversion techniques and evaluate the impact of them to federated learning from the attack perspective. We use eight models and four datasets to evaluate the current gradient inversion techniques, comparing the attack performance as well as the time consumption. Furthermore, we shed light on some important and interesting directions of gradient inversion against federated learning."}
