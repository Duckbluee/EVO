{"abstract":"Social networks play an important role in today’s society and in our relationships with others. They give the Internet user the opportunity to play an active role, e.g., one can relay certain information via a blog, a comment, or even a vote. The Internet user has the possibility to share any content at any time. However, some malicious Internet users take advantage of this freedom to share fake news to manipulate or mislead an audience, to invade the privacy of others, and also to harm certain institutions. Fake news seeks to resemble traditional media to establish its credibility with the public. Its seriousness pushes the public to share them. As a result, fake news can spread quickly. This fake news can cause enormous difficulties for users and institutions. Several authors have proposed systems to detect fake news in social networks using crowd signals through the process of crowdsourcing. Unfortunately, these authors do not use the expertise of the crowd and the expertise of a third party in an associative way to make decisions. Crowds are useful in indicating whether or not a story should be fact-checked. This work proposes a new method of binary aggregation of opinions of the crowd and the knowledge of a third-party expert. The aggregator is based on majority voting on the crowd side and weighted averaging on the third-party side. An experimentation has been conducted on 25 posts and 50 voters. A quantitative comparison with the majority vote model reveals that our aggregation model provides slightly better results due to weights assigned to accredited users. A qualitative investigation against existing aggregation models shows that the proposed approach meets the requirements or properties expected of a crowdsourcing system and a voting system."}
