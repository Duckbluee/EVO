{"abstract":"In a recent breakthrough STOC 2015 paper, a continuous diffusion process was considered on hypergraphs (which has been refined in a recent JACM 2018 paper) to define a Laplacian operator, whose spectral properties satisfy the celebrated Cheeger’s inequality. However, one peculiar aspect of this diffusion process is that each hyperedge directs flow only from vertices with the maximum density to those with the minimum density, while ignoring vertices having strict in-beween densities."}
