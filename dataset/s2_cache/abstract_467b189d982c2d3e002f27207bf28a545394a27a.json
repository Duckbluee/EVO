{"abstract":"Knowledge graphs that encapsulate personal health information, or personal health knowledge graphs (PHKG), can help enable personalized health care in knowledge-driven systems. In this paper we provide a short survey of existing work surrounding the emerging paradigm of PHKGs and highlight the major challenges that remain. We find that while some preliminary exploration exists on the topic of personal knowledge graphs, development of PHKGs remains under-explored. A range of challenges surrounding the collection, linkage, and maintenance of personal health knowledge remains to be addressed to fully realize PHKGs."}
