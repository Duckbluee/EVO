{"abstract":"Traffic simulation is a crucial tool for transportation decision-making and policy development. However, achieving realistic simulations in the face of the high dimensionality and heterogeneity of traffic environments is a longstanding challenge. In this paper, we present TransWordNG, a traffic simulator that uses Data-driven algorithms and Graph Computing techniques to learn traffic dynamics from real data. The functionality and structure of TransWorldNG are introduced, which utilize a foundation model for transportation management and control. The results demonstrate that TransWorldNG can generate more realistic traffic patterns compared to traditional simulators. Additionally, TransWorldNG exhibits better scalability, as it shows linear growth in computation time as the scenario scale increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first traffic simulator that can automatically learn traffic patterns from real-world data and efficiently generate accurate and realistic traffic environments."}
