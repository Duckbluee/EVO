{"abstract":"Ever since human society entered the age of social media, every user has had a considerable amount of visual content stored online and shared in variant virtual communities. As an efficient information circulation measure, disastrous consequences are possible if the contents of images are tampered with by malicious actors. Specifically, we are witnessing the rapid development of machine learning (ML) based tools like DeepFake apps. They are capable of exploiting images on social media platforms to mimic a potential victim without their knowledge or consent. These content manipulation attacks can lead to the rapid spread of misinformation that may not only mislead friends or family members but also has the potential to cause chaos in public domains. Therefore, robust image authentication is critical to detect and filter off manipulated images. In this paper, we introduce a system that accurately AUthenticates SOcial MEdia images (AUSOME) uploaded to online platforms leveraging spectral analysis and ML. Images from DALL-E 2 are compared with genuine images from the Stanford image dataset. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) are used to perform a spectral comparison. Additionally, based on the differences in their frequency response, an ML model is proposed to classify social media images as genuine or AI-generated. Using real-world scenarios, the AUSOME system is evaluated on its detection accuracy. The experimental results are encouraging and they verified the potential of the AUSOME scheme in social media image authentications."}
