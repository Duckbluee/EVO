{"abstract":"Keyphrase extraction is the starting phase of feature extraction and many other NLP tasks. Hence, keyphrase extraction ensures the separation of essential and relevant information from the rest of the document or corpus. A similarity score is used for detecting similarities between two or more documents. In this paper, a summary of existing research conducted in the field of keyphrase extraction and source code similarity detection is presented. The literature focuses on more concept-based research instead of going towards the domain level. There exist a promising potential for the creation of recommendation systems by employing similarly situated research techniques."}
