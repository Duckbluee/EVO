{"abstract":"The less training data and insufficient supervision limit the performance of the deep supervised models for brain disease diagnosis. It is significant to construct a learning framework that can capture more information in limited data and insufficient supervision. To address these issues, we focus on self-supervised learning and aim to generalize the self-supervised learning to the brain networks, which are non-Euclidean graph data. More specifically, we propose an ensemble masked graph self-supervised framework named BrainGSLs, which incorporates 1) a local topological-aware encoder that takes the partially visible nodes as input and learns these latent representations, 2) a node-edge bi-decoder that reconstructs the masked edges by the representations of both the masked and visible nodes, 3) a signal representation learning module for capturing temporal representations from BOLD signals and 4) a classifier used for the classification. We evaluate our model on three real medical clinical applications: diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BD) and diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The results suggest that the proposed self-supervised training has led to remarkable improvement and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our method is able to identify the biomarkers associated with the diseases, which is consistent with the previous studies. We also explore the correlation of these three diseases and find the strong association between ASD and BD. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt of applying the idea of self-supervised learning with masked autoencoder on the brain network analysis."}
