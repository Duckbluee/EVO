{"abstract":"Gait recognition is an emerging biometric technology for identifying pedestrians based on their unique walking patterns. In past gait recognition, global-based methods are inadequate to meet the growing demand for accuracy, while commonly used part-based methods provided coarse and inaccurate feature representation for specific body parts. Human parsing appears to be a better option for accurately representing specific and complete body parts in gait recognition. However, its practical application in gait recognition is often hindered by missing RGB modality, lack of annotated body parts, and difficulty in balancing parsing quantity and quality. To address this issue, we propose LandmarkGait, an accessible and alternative parsing-based solution for gait recognition. LandmarkGait introduces an unsupervised landmark discovery network to transform the dense silhouette into a finite set of landmarks with remarkable consistency across various conditions. By grouping landmarks subsets corresponding to distinct body part regions, following a reconstruction task and further refinement from high-quality input silhouettes, we can directly obtain fine-grained parsing results from original binary silhouettes in an unsupervised manner. Moreover, we also develop a multi-scale feature extractor that simultaneously captures global and parsing feature representations based on the integrity and flexibility of specific body parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LandmarkGait can extract more stable features and exhibit significant performance improvement under all conditions, especially in various dressing conditions.
