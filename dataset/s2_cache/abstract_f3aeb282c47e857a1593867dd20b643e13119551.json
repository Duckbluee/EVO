{"abstract":"Previous AutoML pruning works utilized individual layer features to automatically prune filters. We analyze the correlation for two layers from the different blocks which have a short-cut structure. It shows that, in one block, the deeper layer has many redundant filters which can be represented by filters in the former layer. So, it is necessary to take information from other layers into consideration in pruning. In this paper, a novel pruning method, named GraphPruning, is proposed. Any series of the network is viewed as a graph. To automatically aggregate neighboring features for each node, a graph aggregator based on graph convolution networks (GCN) is designed. In the training stage, a PruningNet that is given aggregated node features generates reasonable weights for any size of the sub-network. Subsequently, the best configuration of the Pruned Network is searched by reinforcement learning. Different from previous work, we take the node features from a well-trained graph aggregator instead of the hand-craft features, as the states in reinforcement learning. Compared with other AutoML pruning works, our method has achieved the state-of-the-art under the same conditions on ImageNet-2012."}
