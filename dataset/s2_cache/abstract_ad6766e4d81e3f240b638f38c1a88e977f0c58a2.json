{"abstract":"Due to the pivotal role of recommender systems (RS) in guiding customers toward the purchase, there is a natural motivation for unscrupulous parties to spoof RS for profits. In this article, we study shilling attacks where an adversarial party injects a number of fake user profiles for improper purposes. Conventional Shilling Attack approaches lack attack transferability (i.e., attacks are not effective on some victim RS models) and/or attack invisibility (i.e., injected profiles can be easily detected). To overcome these issues, we present learning to generate fake user profiles (Leg-UP), a novel attack model based on the generative adversarial network. Leg-UP learns user behavior patterns from real users in the sampled “templates” and constructs fake user profiles. To simulate real users, the generator in Leg-UP directly outputs discrete ratings. To enhance attack transferability, the parameters of the generator are optimized by maximizing the attack performance on a surrogate RS model. To improve attack invisibility, Leg-UP adopts a discriminator to guide the generator to generate undetectable fake user profiles. Experiments on benchmarks have shown that Leg-UP exceeds state-of-the-art shilling attack methods on a wide range of victim RS models.
