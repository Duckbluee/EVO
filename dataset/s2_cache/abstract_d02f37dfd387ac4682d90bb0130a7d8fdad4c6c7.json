{"abstract":"We praise Jordan for bringing much needed clarity about the current status of Artificial Intelligence (AI)—what it currently is and what it is not—as well as explaining the current challenges lying ahead and outlining what is missing and remains to be done. Jordan makes several claims supported by a list of talking points that we hope will reach a wide audience; ideally, that audience will include academic, university, and governmental leaders, at a time where significant resources are being allocated to AI for research and education."}
