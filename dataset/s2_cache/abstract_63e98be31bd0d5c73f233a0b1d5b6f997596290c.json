{"abstract":"Text classification in natural language processing (NLP) is evolving rapidly, particularly with the surge in transformer-based models, including large language models (LLM). This paper presents an in-depth survey of text classification techniques across diverse benchmarks, addressing applications from sentiment analysis to chatbot-driven question-answering. Methodologically, it utilizes NLP-facilitated approaches such as co-citation and bibliographic coupling alongside traditional research techniques. Because new use cases continue to emerge in this dynamic field, the study proposes an expanded taxonomy of text classification applications, extending the focus beyond unimodal (text-only) inputs to explore the emerging field of multimodal classification. While offering a comprehensive review of text classification with LLMs, this review highlights novel questions that arise when approaching the task with transformers: It evaluates the use of multimodal data, including text, numeric, and columnar data, and discusses the evolution of text input lengths (tokens) for long text classification; it covers the historical development of transformer-based models, emphasizing recent advancements in LLMs; it evaluates model accuracy on 358 datasets across 20 applications, with results challenging the assumption that LLMs are universally superior, revealing unexpected findings related to accuracy, cost, and safety; and it explores issues related to cost and access as models become increasingly expensive. Finally, the survey discusses new social and ethical implications raised when using LLMs for text classification, including bias and copyright. Throughout, the review emphasizes the importance of a nuanced understanding of model performance and a holistic approach to deploying transformer-based models in real-world applications."}
