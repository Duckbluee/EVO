{"abstract":"Securing crypto-cores is becoming increasingly difficult with the advent of electro-magnetic (EM) side-channel analysis (EMSCA) and fault injection attacks (FIAs). This letter presents an Ansys high-frequency structure simulator (HFSS)-based simulation framework for EM analysis of an integrated on-chip sensor for detecting EMSCA and FIA and validates the efficacy of an on-chip higher metal layer loop-based zero area-overhead sensor using a custom-built 65-nm CMOS IC. A simple technique for incoming H-probe detection is also presented by measuring the absolute average of the induced voltage for every encryption."}
