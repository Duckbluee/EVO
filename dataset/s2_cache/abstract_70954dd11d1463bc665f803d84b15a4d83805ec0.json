{"abstract":"Thanks to regulatory policies such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), it is essential to provide users with the right to erasure regarding their own private data, even if such data has been used to train a neural network model. Such a machine unlearning problem becomes even more challenging in the context of federated learning, where clients collaborate to train a global model with their private data. When a client requests its data to be erased, its effects have already gradually permeated through a large number of clients, as the server aggregates client updates over multiple communication rounds. All of these affected clients need to participate in the retraining process, leading to prohibitive retraining costs with respect to the wall-clock training time.In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Knot, a new clustered aggregation mechanism custom-tailored to asynchronous federated learning. The design of Knot is based upon our intuition that, with asynchronous federated learning, clients can be divided into clusters, and aggregation can be performed within each cluster only so that retraining due to data erasure can be limited to within each cluster as well. To optimize client-cluster assignment, we formulated a lexicographical minimization problem that could be transformed into a linear programming problem and solved efficiently. Over a variety of datasets and tasks, we have shown clear evidence that Knot outperformed the state-of-the-art federated unlearning mechanisms by up to 85% in the context of asynchronous federated learning."}
