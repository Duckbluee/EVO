{"abstract":"In prediction tasks, there exist features that are related to the label in the same way across different settings for that task; these are semantic features or semantics. Features with varying relationships to the label are nuisances. For example, in detecting cows from natural images, the shape of the head is semantic but because images of cows often have grass backgrounds but not always, the background is a nuisance. Models that exploit nuisance-label relationships face performance degradation when these relationships change. Building models robust to such changes requires additional knowledge beyond samples of the features and labels. For example, existing work uses annotations of nuisances or assumes ERM-trained models depend on nuisances. Approaches to integrate new kinds of additional knowledge enlarge the settings where robust models can be built. We develop an approach to use knowledge about the semantics by corrupting them in data, and then using the corrupted data to produce models which identify correlations between nuisances and the label. Once these correlations are identified, they can be used to adjust for where nuisances drive predictions. We study semantic corruptions in powering different spurious-correlation avoiding methods on multiple out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks like classifying waterbirds, natural language inference (NLI), and detecting cardiomegaly in chest X-rays."}
