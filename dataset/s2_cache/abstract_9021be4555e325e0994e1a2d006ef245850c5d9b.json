{"abstract":"Open-source software (OSS) is a critical part of the software supply chain. Recent social engineering attacks against OSS development teams have enabled attackers to become code contributors and later inject malicious code or vulnerabilities into the project with the goal of compromising dependent software. The attackers have exploited interactions among development team members and the social dynamics of team behavior to enable their attacks. We introduce a security approach that leverages signatures and patterns of team dynamics to predict the susceptibility of a software development team to social engineering attacks that enable access to the OSS project code. The proposed approach is programming language-, platform-, and vulnerability-agnostic because it assesses the artifacts of OSS team interactions, rather than OSS code."}
