{"abstract":"With the Internet of Things (IoT) devices becoming an integral part of human life, the need for robust anomaly detection in streaming data has also been elevated. Dozens of distance-based, density-based, kernel-based, and cluster-based algorithms have been proposed in the area of anomaly detection. Recently, because of the robustness of the deep neural networks (DNN), different deep learning-based anomaly detection methods have also been proposed. With all these rapid developments, there exists a small number of comparative studies for anomaly detection methods. Even in those studies, the comparison is done only in typical anomaly detection settings without taking the streaming data into consideration. The presence of intrinsic time-series characteristics like trend, seasonality, and change-point makes it important to study the behavior of commonly used anomaly detection methods on streaming data. Moreover, the comparison of traditional methods with deep learning-based methods also brings exciting insights about the data which are generally overlooked by traditional methods. In this study, we compare 13 anomaly detection methods on two commonly used streaming data sets. We used four different evaluation metrics to evaluate the methods from different perspectives. Our analysis reveals that the deep learning-based anomaly detection methods are superior to traditional anomaly detection methods."}
