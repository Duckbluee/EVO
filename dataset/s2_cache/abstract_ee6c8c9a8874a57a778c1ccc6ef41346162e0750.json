{"abstract":"Extracting a Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation from multiple camera images offers a cost-effective, scalable alternative to LIDAR-based solutions in autonomous driving. However, the performance of the existing BEV methods drops significantly under various corruptions such as brightness and weather changes or camera failures. To improve the robustness of BEV perception, we propose to adapt a large vision foundational model, DINOv2, to BEV estimation using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach builds on the strong representation space of DINOv2 by adapting it to the BEV task in a state-of-the-art framework, SimpleBEV. Our experiments show increased robustness of BEV perception under various corruptions, with increasing gains from scaling up the model and the input resolution. We also showcase the effectiveness of the adapted representations in terms of fewer learnable parameters and faster convergence during training."}
