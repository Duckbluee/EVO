{"abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel method for detecting fake and Large Language Model (LLM)-generated profiles in the LinkedIn Online Social Network immediately upon registration and before establishing connections. Early fake profile identification is crucial to maintaining the platform's integrity since it prevents imposters from acquiring the private and sensitive information of legitimate users and from gaining an opportunity to increase their credibility for future phishing and scamming activities. This work uses textual information provided in LinkedIn profiles and introduces the Section and Subsection Tag Embedding (SSTE) method to enhance the discriminative characteristics of these data for distinguishing between legitimate profiles and those created by imposters manually or by using an LLM. Additionally, the dearth of a large publicly available LinkedIn dataset motivated us to collect 3600 LinkedIn profiles for our research. We release our dataset publicly for research purposes. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first large publicly available LinkedIn dataset for fake LinkedIn account detection. Within our paradigm, we assess static and contextualized word embeddings, including GloVe, Flair, BERT, and RoBERTa. We show that the suggested method can distinguish between legitimate and fake profiles with an accuracy of about 95% across all word embeddings. In addition, we show that SSTE has a promising accuracy for identifying LLM-generated profiles, despite the fact that no LLM-generated profiles were employed during the training phase, and can achieve an accuracy of approximately 90% when only 20 LLM-generated profiles are added to the training set. It is a significant finding since the proliferation of several LLMs in the near future makes it extremely challenging to design a single system that can identify profiles created with various LLMs."}
