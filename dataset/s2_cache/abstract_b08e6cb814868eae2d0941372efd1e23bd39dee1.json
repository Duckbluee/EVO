{"abstract":"Anomaly detection in surveillance videos is challenging but important for ensuring public security. Different from pixel-based anomaly detection methods, pose-based methods utilize highly-structured skeleton data, which decreases the computational burden and also avoids the negative impact of background noise. However, pose-based methods lack an alternative dynamic representation akin to the explicit motion features, such as optical flow, employed by pixel-based methods. In this paper, a novel Motion Embedder (ME), a label-efficient scheme without extra annotation efforts, is proposed to provide a pose motion representation for the structured posed data from a probability perspective. Furthermore, a novel task-specific Spatial-Temporal Transformer (STT) is deployed for self-supervised pose sequence reconstruction. These two modules are then integrated into a unified framework for pose regularity learning, which is referred to as Motion Prior Regularity Learner (MoPRL). MoPRL achieves competitive results on multiple challenging datasets while minimizing computational costs. Extensive experiments validate the versatility of the proposed modules and provide insights for future research."}
