{"abstract":"In the current scenario of fast technological advancement, increasingly characterized by widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven tools, the significance of autonomous systems like chatbots has been highlighted. Such systems, which are proficient in addressing queries based on PDF files, hold the potential to revolutionize customer support and post-sales services in the automotive sector, resulting in time and resource optimization. Within this scenario, this work explores the adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create AI-assisted tools for the automotive sector, assuming three distinct methods for comparative analysis. For them, broad assessment criteria are considered in order to encompass response accuracy, cost, and user experience. The achieved results demonstrate that the choice of the most adequate method in this context hinges on the selected criteria, with different practical implications. Therefore, this work provides insights into the effectiveness and applicability of chatbots in the automotive industry, particularly when interfacing with automotive manuals, facilitating the implementation of productive generative AI strategies that meet the demands of the sector."}
