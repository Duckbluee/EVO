{"abstract":"Recently, the log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree) has been widely adopted for use in the storage layer of modern NoSQL systems. Because of this, there have been a large number of research efforts, from both the database community and the operating systems community, that try to improve various aspects of LSM-trees. In this paper, we provide a survey of recent research efforts on LSM-trees so that readers can learn the state of the art in LSM-based storage techniques. We provide a general taxonomy to classify the literature of LSM-trees, survey the efforts in detail, and discuss their strengths and trade-offs. We further survey several representative LSM-based open-source NoSQL systems and discuss some potential future research directions resulting from the survey."}
