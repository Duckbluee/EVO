{"abstract":"With the increasing demand for intelligent services, the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will shift from a traditional architecture that focuses solely on a high transmission rate to a new architecture that is based on the intelligent connection of everything. Semantic communication (SemCom), a revolutionary architecture that integrates user as well as application requirements and the meaning of information into data processing and transmission, is predicted to become a new core paradigm in 6G. While SemCom is expected to progress beyond the classical Shannon paradigm, several obstacles need to be overcome on the way to a SemCom-enabled smart Internet. In this paper, we first highlight the motivations and compelling reasons for SemCom in 6G. Then, we provide an overview of SemCom-related theory development. After that, we introduce three types of SemCom, i.e., semantic-oriented communication, goal-oriented communication, and semantic-aware communication. Following that, we organize the design of the communication system into three dimensions, i.e., semantic information (SI) extraction, SI transmission, and SI metrics. For each dimension, we review existing techniques and discuss their benefits and limitations, as well as the remaining challenges. Then, we introduce the potential applications of SemCom in 6G and portray the vision of future SemCom-empowered network architecture. Finally, we outline future research opportunities. In a nutshell, this paper provides a holistic review of the fundamentals of SemCom, its applications in 6G networks, and the existing challenges and open issues with insights for further in-depth investigations."}
