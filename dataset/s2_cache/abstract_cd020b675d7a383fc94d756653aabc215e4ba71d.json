{"abstract":"Chemogenomics data generally refers to the activity data of chemical compounds on an array of protein targets and represents an important source of information for building in silico target prediction models. The increasing volume of chemogenomics data offers exciting opportunities to build models based on Big Data. Preparing a high quality data set is a vital step in realizing this goal and this work aims to compile such a comprehensive chemogenomics dataset. This dataset comprises over 70 million SAR data points from publicly available databases (PubChem and ChEMBL) including structure, target information and activity annotations. Our aspiration is to create a useful chemogenomics resource reflecting industry-scale data not only for building predictive models of in silico polypharmacology and off-target effects but also for the validation of cheminformatics approaches in general."}
