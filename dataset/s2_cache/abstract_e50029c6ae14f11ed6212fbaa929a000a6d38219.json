{"abstract":"With the development of deep learning and artificial intelligence, audio synthesis has a pivotal role in the area of machine learning and shows strong applicability in the industry. Meanwhile, significant efforts have been dedicated by researchers to handle multimodal tasks at present such as audio-visual multimodal processing. In this paper, we conduct a survey on audio synthesis and audio-visual multimodal processing, which helps understand current research and future trends. This review focuses on text to speech(TTS), music generation and some tasks that combine visual and acoustic information. The corresponding technical methods are comprehensively classified and introduced, and their future development trends are prospected. This survey can provide some guidance for researchers who are interested in the areas like audio synthesis and audio-visual multimodal processing."}
