{"abstract":"Current graph representation learning techniques use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract features from dataset embeddings. In this work, we examine the quality of these embeddings and assess how changing them can affect the accuracy of GNNs. We explore different embedding extraction techniques for both images and texts; and find that the performance of different GNN architectures is dependent on the embedding style used. We see a prevalence of bag of words (BoW) embeddings and text classification tasks in available graph datasets. Given the impact embeddings has on GNN performance. this leads to a phenomenon that GNNs being optimised for BoW vectors."}
