{"abstract":"Co-morbid disease condition refers to the simultaneous presence of one or more diseases along with the primary disease. A patient suffering from co-morbid diseases possess more mortality risk than with a disease alone. So, it is necessary to predict co-morbid disease pairs. In past years, though several methods have been proposed by researchers for predicting the co-morbid diseases, not much work is done in prediction using knowledge graph embedding using tensor factorization. Moreover, the complex-valued vector-based tensor factorization is not being used in any knowledge graph with biological and biomedical entities. We propose a tensor factorization based approach on biological knowledge graphs. Our method introduces the concept of complex-valued embedding in knowledge graphs with biological entities. Here, we build a knowledge graph with disease-gene associations and their corresponding background information. To predict the association between prevalent diseases, we use ComplEx embedding based tensor decomposition method. Besides, we obtain new prevalent disease pairs using the MCL algorithm in a disease-gene-gene network and check their corresponding inter-relations using edge prediction task."}
