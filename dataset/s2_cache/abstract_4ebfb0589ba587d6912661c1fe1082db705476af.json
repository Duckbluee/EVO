{"abstract":"Large Language Models (LLMs), used in creative writing, code generation, and translation, generate text based on input sequences but are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where crafted prompts induce harmful outputs. Most jailbreak prompt methods use a combination of jailbreak templates followed by questions to ask to create jailbreak prompts. However, existing jailbreak prompt designs generally suffer from excessive semantic differences, resulting in an inability to resist defenses that use simple semantic metrics as thresholds. Jailbreak prompts are semantically more varied than the original questions used for queries. In this paper, we introduce a Semantic Mirror Jailbreak (SMJ) approach that bypasses LLMs by generating jailbreak prompts that are semantically similar to the original question. We model the search for jailbreak prompts that satisfy both semantic similarity and jailbreak validity as a multi-objective optimization problem and employ a standardized set of genetic algorithms for generating eligible prompts. Compared to the baseline AutoDAN-GA, SMJ achieves attack success rates (ASR) that are at most 35.4% higher without ONION defense and 85.2% higher with ONION defense. SMJ's better performance in all three semantic meaningfulness metrics of Jailbreak Prompt, Similarity, and Outlier, also means that SMJ is resistant to defenses that use those metrics as thresholds."}
