{"abstract":"Natural language has been the holy grail of query interface designers, but has generally been considered too hard to work with, except in limited specific circumstances. In this paper, we describe the architecture of an interactive natural language query interface for relational databases. Through a carefully limited interaction with the user, we are able to correctly interpret complex natural language queries, in a generic manner across a range of domains. By these means, a logically complex English language sentence is correctly translated into a SQL query, which may include aggregation, nesting, and various types of joins, among other things, and can be evaluated against an RDBMS. We have constructed a system, NaLIR (Natural Language Interface for Relational databases), embodying these ideas. Our experimental assessment, through user studies, demonstrates that NaLIR is good enough to be usable in practice: even naive users are able to specify quite complex ad-hoc queries."}
