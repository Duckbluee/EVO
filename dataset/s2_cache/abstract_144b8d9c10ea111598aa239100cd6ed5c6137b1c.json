{"abstract":"Artificial intelligence as part of future practices in the architect’s work: MidJourney generative tool as part of a process of creating an architectural form The article presents an overview of how the MidJourney generative script based on artificial intelligence works for its potential use in architec ­ tural practice. The purpose of the research is to present the potential of the tool in the context of supporting creative processes. The discussion of the performance of the script was carried out on the basis of the author’s research resulting from work conducted with the tool; clear examples are the basis for introducing the reader to the mechanics of the script’s operation and pointing out cases in which the process bears the hallmarks of the abi ­ lity of correct autonomous thinking. The result of the research, not merely a description, but visible also in the digital images generated by the script included in the article, shows the full potential of the tool. On the basis of these findings, its usefulness in architectural design practice was analysed."}
