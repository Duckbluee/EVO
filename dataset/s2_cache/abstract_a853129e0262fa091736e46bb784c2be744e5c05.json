{"abstract":"We unify $\\textit{kernel density estimation}$ and $\\textit{empirical Bayes}$ and address a set of problems in unsupervised learning with a geometric interpretation of those methods, rooted in the $\\textit{concentration of measure}$ phenomenon. Kernel density is viewed symbolically as $X\\rightharpoonup Y$ where the random variable $X$ is smoothed to $Y= X+N(0,\\sigma^2 I_d)$, and empirical Bayes is the machinery to denoise in a least-squares sense, which we express as $X \\leftharpoondown Y$. A learning objective is derived by combining these two, symbolically captured by $X \\rightleftharpoons Y$. Crucially, instead of using the original nonparametric estimators, we parametrize $\\textit{the energy function}$ with a neural network denoted by $\\phi$; at optimality, $\\nabla \\phi \\approx -\\nabla \\log f$ where $f$ is the density of $Y$. The optimization problem is abstracted as interactions of high-dimensional spheres which emerge due to the concentration of isotropic gaussians. We introduce two algorithmic frameworks based on this machinery: (i) a \"walk-jump\" sampling scheme that combines Langevin MCMC (walks) and empirical Bayes (jumps), and (ii) a probabilistic framework for $\\textit{associative memory}$, called NEBULA, defined a la Hopfield by the $\\textit{gradient flow}$ of the learned energy to a set of attractors. We finish the paper by reporting the emergence of very rich \"creative memories\" as attractors of NEBULA for highly-overlapping spheres."}
