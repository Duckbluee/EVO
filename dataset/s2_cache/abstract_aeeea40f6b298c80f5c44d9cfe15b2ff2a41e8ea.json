{"abstract":"The traffic anomaly analysis in IoT-based intelligent transportation system (ITS) is crucial to improving public transportation safety and efficiency. The issue is also challenging due to the unbalanced distribution of anomaly data in IoT-based ITS, which may cause overfitting or underfitting in the training phase. However, some research on traffic anomaly analysis injected limited data to address the shortage of anomaly samples or even neglects this issue, which overlooks the potential representation of nodes in graph neural networks. In this paper, we propose an improved contrastive GNN-based learning framework for traffic anomaly analysis that alleviates the problem of imbalanced datasets in the training phase. In this framework, we provide a graph augmentation approach with coupled features to learn different views of graph data. Besides, we design an effective training method based on the contrastive loss for our framework, which can learn the better performance of latent representations utilized in the downstream tasks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed frame-works based on real-world datasets. We demonstrate that our framework achieves as high as 6.45% precision improvement compared to the state-of-the-art."}
