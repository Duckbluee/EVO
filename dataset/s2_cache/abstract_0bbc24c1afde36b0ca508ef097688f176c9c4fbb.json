{"abstract":"Human action recognition systems use data collected from a wide range of sensors to accurately identify and interpret human actions. One of the most challenging issues for computer vision is the automatic and precise identification of human activities. A significant increase in feature learning-based representations for action recognition has emerged in recent years, due to the widespread use of deep learning-based features. This study presents an in-depth analysis of human activity recognition that investigates recent developments in computer vision. Augmented reality, human–computer interaction, cybersecurity, home monitoring, and surveillance cameras are all examples of computer vision applications that often go in conjunction with human action detection. We give a taxonomy-based, rigorous study of human activity recognition techniques, discussing the best ways to acquire human action features, derived using RGB and depth data, as well as the latest research on deep learning and hand-crafted techniques. We also explain a generic architecture to recognize human actions in the real world and its current prominent research topic. At long last, we are able to offer some study analysis concepts and proposals for academics. In-depth researchers of human action recognition will find this review an effective tool."}
