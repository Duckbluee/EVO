{"abstract":"In this paper, we study the problem of multi-source cross-network node classification, which aims to classify unlabeled nodes in a target network by leveraging the knowledge learned from the rich labeled nodes in multiple source networks. The existing multi-source transfer learning approaches generally fail to model the structural information of networks, and the current cross-network node classification models mainly neglect that not all source networks can boost the task performance in the target network. Thus, none can be directly applied to the multi-source cross-network node classification task. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-source data selection (MSDS) based framework for cross-network node classification, which integrates multi-source transfer learning with network embedding to learn label-discriminative and network-invariant node representations. In MSDS, we first propose the multi-source network data selection, which applies three distances to jointly select the transferable source networks to well alleviate the problem of suboptimal solution or even negative transfer. In addition, we devise a new feature information alignment technique to make node vector representations network-invariant. Moreover, we incorporate aggregated structural information and feature information to make node representations label-discriminative. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches outperform the state-of-the-art non-transfer and single-source transfer approaches in terms of classification accuracy."}
