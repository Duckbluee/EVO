{"abstract":"Despite significant breakthroughs in video analysis driven by the rapid development of large multimodal models (LMMs), there remains a lack of a versatile evaluation benchmark to comprehensively assess these models' performance in video understanding and reasoning. To address this, we present VideoVista, a video QA benchmark that integrates challenges across diverse content categories, durations, and abilities. Specifically, VideoVista comprises 25,000 questions derived from 3,400 videos spanning 14 categories (e.g., Howto, Film, and Entertainment) with durations ranging from a few seconds to over 10 minutes. Besides, it encompasses 19 types of understanding tasks (e.g., anomaly detection, interaction understanding) and 8 reasoning tasks (e.g., logical reasoning, causal reasoning). To achieve this, we present an automatic data construction framework, leveraging powerful GPT-4o alongside advanced analysis tools (e.g., video splitting, object segmenting, and tracking). We also utilize this framework to construct training data to enhance the capabilities of video-related LMMs (Video-LMMs). Through a comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of cutting-edge models, we reveal that: 1) Video-LMMs face difficulties in fine-grained video tasks involving temporal location, object tracking, and anomaly detection; 2) Video-LMMs present inferior logical and relation reasoning abilities; 3) Open-source Video-LMMs' performance is significantly lower than GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5, lagging by 20 points. This highlights the crucial role VideoVista will play in advancing LMMs that can accurately understand videos and perform precise reasoning."}
