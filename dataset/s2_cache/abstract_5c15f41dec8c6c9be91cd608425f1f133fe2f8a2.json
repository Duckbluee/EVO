{"abstract":"Automated logging statement generation supports developers in documenting critical software runtime behavior. Given the great success in natural language generation and programming language comprehension, large language models (LLMs) might help developers generate logging statements, but this has not yet been investigated. To fill the gap, this paper performs the first study on exploring LLMs for logging statement generation.We first build a logging statement generation dataset, LogBench, with two parts: (1) LogBench-O: logging statements collected from GitHub repositories, and (2) LogBench-T: the transformed unseen code from LogBench-O. Then, we leverage LogBench to evaluate the effectiveness and generalization capabilities (using LogBench-T) of eleven top-performing LLMs. In addition, we examine the performance of these LLMs against classical retrieval-based and machine learning-based logging methods from the era preceding LLMs. We further evaluate LLM's logging generalization capabilities using unseen data (LogBench-T) derived from code transformation techniques. While existing LLMs deliver decent predictions on logging levels and logging variables, our study indicates that they only achieve a maximum BLEU score of 0.249, thus calling for improvements. The paper also highlights the importance of prompt constructions and external factors (e.g., programming contexts and code comments) for LLMs' logging performance. Based on these findings, we identify five implications and provide practical advice for future logging research. Our empirical analysis discloses the limitations of current logging approaches while showcasing the potential of LLM-based logging tools, and provides actionable guidance for building more practical models."}
