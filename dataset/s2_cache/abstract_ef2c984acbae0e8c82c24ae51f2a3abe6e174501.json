{"abstract":"ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence (AI) art is the product of AI technology applied to art. In terms of technical application, AI art has two methods: symbolism and connectivism. In terms of the human-machine system, there are three levels: human using machine, human guiding machine and human-machine separation. AI art is a special form, existing between natural beauty and human art: AI art, first of all, is not a natural aesthetic object, given that it is the product of artefacts. Its appreciation is mixed with interests, and its artistic generation is a kind of “purposeful non-purposefulness.” Secondly, AI art is not equal to traditional human art, because AI has no intentionality or consciousness. Thirdly, AI participates in the construction of artistic logic and breaks the boundary of traditional art. AI can be regarded as an “agent” in art generation, and together with people constitute the “actor network” of art. The processes of generation, identification and appreciation of AI art include the judgment of true and false. AI art reflects the forced integration of intelligent technology into art, an attempt to rid of contingency, dialectics, and negativity of art. But what we need is the real harmonisation of art and technology. People should use aesthetic reason to guide AI technology."}
