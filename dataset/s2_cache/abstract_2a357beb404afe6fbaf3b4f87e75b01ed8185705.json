{"abstract":"With the proliferation of connected devices including smartphones, novel network connectivity and management methods are needed to meet user Quality of Experience (QoE) and computational demands of contemporary applications. Service caching and computation reuse techniques are being employed to alleviate challenges due to scalability, interoperability, and mobility, as well as to reduce application latency by enabling caching at the edge. This survey provides a taxonomy for service caching and computation reuse and describes the current state of the research and its challenges. This is the first survey that provides a comprehensive analysis and suggests future research directions on this topic."}
