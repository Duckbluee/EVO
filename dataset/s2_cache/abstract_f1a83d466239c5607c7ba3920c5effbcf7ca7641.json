{"abstract":"Vehicle re-identification (re-ID) aims to retrieve the image of the same vehicles across multiple cameras. It has attracted wide attention in the field of computer vision owing to the deployment of surveillance system. However, some unfavorable factors restrict the retrieval accuracy of re-ID; minor inter-class difference and orientation variation are two main issues. In this study, we proposed a multi-branch network based on common field of view (CFVMNet) to address these issues. In the proposed method, we extracted and fused the global and local detail features using four branches and the Batch DropBlock (BDB) strategy to accentuate inter-class difference. We also considered some other attributes (i.e., color, type, and model) in the feature extraction process to make the final features more recognizable. For the issue of orientation variation that could lead to large intra-class difference, we learned two different metrics according to whether there is common field of view of two vehicle images, respectively, which can enable the proposed CFVMNet to focus on different regions. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, VeRi-776 and VehicleID, show that the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches to vehicle re-ID."}
