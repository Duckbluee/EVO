{"abstract":"Maryland DNR is responsible for conducting water clarity assessments to determine if Maryland Chesapeake Bay segments (Segment map via EPA Chesapeake Bay Program) have an adequate light environment for submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) to grow. The Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) conducts annual aerial surveys of the Bay to determine the SAV acreages in each segment (VIMS SAV site). If those segments don’t pass their acreage goals and there are available water quality mapping data, water clarity is assessed to determine if there are enough acres that have suitable acres of clear water to support healthy SAV communities, but may be limited by seed sources or other factors. Visit documents at the EPA CBP site for the technical methods for assessing water clarity and more on the science behind clarity and SAV."}
