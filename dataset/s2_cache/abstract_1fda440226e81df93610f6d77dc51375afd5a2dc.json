{"abstract":"Outsourced computation for neural networks allows users access to state-of-the-art models without investing in specialized hardware and know-how. The problem is that the users lose control over potentially privacy-sensitive data. With homomorphic encryption (HE), a third party can perform computation on encrypted data without revealing its content. In this paper, we reviewed scientific articles and publications in the particular area of Deep Learning Architectures for Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) with Fully HE. We analyzed the changes to neural network models and architectures to make them compatible with HE and how these changes impact performance. Next, we find numerous challenges to HE-based privacy-preserving deep learning, such as computational overhead, usability, and limitations posed by the encryption schemes. Furthermore, we discuss potential solutions to the HE PPML challenges. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics that allow for a better and more meaningful comparison of PPML solutions."}
