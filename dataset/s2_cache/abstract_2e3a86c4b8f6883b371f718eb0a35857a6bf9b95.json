{"abstract":"The adaptive processing of graph data is a long-standing research topic that has been lately consolidated as a theme of major interest in the deep learning community. The snap increase in the amount and breadth of related research has come at the price of little systematization of knowledge and attention to earlier literature. This work is a tutorial introduction to the field of deep learning for graphs. It favors a consistent and progressive presentation of the main concepts and architectural aspects over an exposition of the most recent literature, for which the reader is referred to available surveys. The paper takes a top-down view of the problem, introducing a generalized formulation of graph representation learning based on a local and iterative approach to structured information processing. Moreover, it introduces the basic building blocks that can be combined to design novel and effective neural models for graphs. We complement the methodological exposition with a discussion of interesting research challenges and applications in the field."}
