{"abstract":"Social Robots (SRs) are substantially becoming part of modern society, given their frequent use in many areas of application including education, communication, assistance, and entertainment. The main challenge in human–robot interaction is in achieving human-like and affective interaction between the two groups. This study is aimed at endowing SRs with the capability of assessing the emotional state of the interlocutor, by analyzing his/her psychophysiological signals. The methodology is focused on remote evaluations of the subject’s peripheral neuro-vegetative activity by means of thermal infrared imaging. The approach was developed and tested for a particularly challenging use case: the interaction between children and a commercial educational robot, Mio Amico Robot, produced by LiscianiGiochi©. The emotional state classified from the thermal signal analysis was compared to the emotional state recognized by a facial action coding system. The proposed approach was reliable and accurate and favored a personalized and improved interaction of children with SRs."}
