{"abstract":"Machine learning as a service (MLaaS) plays an essential role in the current ecosystem. Enterprises do not need to train models by themselves separately. Instead, they can use well-trained models provided by MLaaS to support business activities. However, such an ecosystem could be threatened by model extraction attacks—an attacker steals the functionality of a trained model provided by MLaaS and builds a substitute model locally. In this paper, we proposed a model extraction method with low query costs and high accuracy. In particular, we use pre-trained models and task-relevant data to decrease the size of query data. We use instance selection to reduce query samples. In addition, we divided query data into two categories, namely low-confidence data and high-confidence data, to reduce the budget and improve accuracy. We then conducted attacks on two models provided by Microsoft Azure as our experiments. The results show that our scheme achieves high accuracy at low cost, with the substitution models achieving 96.10% and 95.24% substitution while querying only 7.32% and 5.30% of their training data on the two models, respectively. This new attack approach creates additional security challenges for models deployed on cloud platforms. It raises the need for novel mitigation strategies to secure the models. In future work, generative adversarial networks and model inversion attacks can be used to generate more diverse data to be applied to the attacks."}
