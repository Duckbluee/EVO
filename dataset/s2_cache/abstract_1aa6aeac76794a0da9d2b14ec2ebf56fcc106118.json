{"abstract":"Domain adaptation aims to bridge the domain shifts between the source and the target domain. These shifts may span different dimensions such as fog, rainfall, etc. However, recent methods typically do not consider explicit prior knowledge about the domain shifts on a specific dimension, thus leading to less desired adaptation performance. In this article, we study a practical setting called Specific Domain Adaptation (SDA) that aligns the source and target domains in a demanded-specific dimension. Within this setting, we observe the intra-domain gap induced by different domainness (i.e., numerical magnitudes of domain shifts in this dimension) is crucial when adapting to a specific domain. To address the problem, we propose a novel Self-Adversarial Disentangling (SAD) framework. In particular, given a specific dimension, we first enrich the source domain by introducing a domainness creator with providing additional supervisory signals. Guided by the created domainness, we design a self-adversarial regularizer and two loss functions to jointly disentangle the latent representations into domainness-specific and domainness-invariant features, thus mitigating the intra-domain gap. Our method can be easily taken as a plug-and-play framework and does not introduce any extra costs in the inference time. We achieve consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both object detection and semantic segmentation."}
