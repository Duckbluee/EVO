{"abstract":"Image reconstruction from computed tomography (CT) measurement is a challenging statistical inverse problem since a high-dimensional conditional distribution needs to be estimated. Based on training data obtained from high-quality reconstructions, we aim to learn a conditional density of images from noisy low-dose CT measurements. To tackle this problem, we propose a hybrid conditional normalizing flow, which integrates the physical model by using the filtered back-projection as conditioner. We evaluate our approach on a low-dose CT benchmark and demonstrate superior performance in terms of structural similarity of our flow-based method compared to other deep learning based approaches."}
