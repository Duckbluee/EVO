{"abstract":"We investigate whether large language models can perform the creative hypothesis generation that human researchers regularly do. While the error rate is high, generative AI seems to be able to effectively structure vast amounts of scientific knowledge and provide interesting and testable hypotheses. The future scientific enterprise may include synergistic efforts with a swarm of\"hypothesis machines\", challenged by automated experimentation and adversarial peer reviews."}
