{"abstract":"(or ciproﬂoxacin) were diluted into fresh LB at the equivalent of 1/10,000 of a dense culture, and once again introduced to varying concentrations of halicin (or ciproﬂoxacin) at two-fold serial dilutions. This procedure was performed every 24 hr over the course of 30 days. For spontaneous suppressor generation, (cid:1) 10 9 CFU of E. coli BW25113 grown in LB media was spread onto LB agar in 10 cm Petri dishes, either without antibiotics or supplemented with ciproﬂoxacin (Millipore Sigma) or halicin (TCI Chemicals) at the indicated concentrations. Plates were subsequently incubated at 37 (cid:4) C for seven days, at which time colonies from each plate were re-streaked onto LB and LB supplemented with antibiotics at the same concentration on which the colonies were originally grown. These plates were grown at 37 (cid:4) C overnight to monitor re-growth. For strain engineering, E. coli BW25113 D nsfA ::kan D nfsB ::cat was derived from BW25113 D nsfA ::kan via introduction of a cat gene to disrupt the nfsB ORF using the Lambda Red method (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000). Brieﬂy, 2 mL 2x YT media with BW25113 D nsfA"}
