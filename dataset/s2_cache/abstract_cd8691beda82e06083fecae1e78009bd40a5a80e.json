{"abstract":"Accurate and fast estimations or predictions of the (near) future location of the users of head-mounted devices within the virtual omnidirectional environment open a plethora of opportunities in application domains such as interactive immersive gaming and tele-surgery. Therefore, the past years have seen growing attention to models for viewport prediction in 360֯ environments. Among the approaches, content-agnostic, trajectory-based methods have the potential to provide very fast solutions, as they do not require complex analysis of the videos to provide a prediction. However, accurate trajectory-based viewport prediction is rather difficult due to the intrinsic variability in user behaviour. Furthermore, even when making use of machine learning, current approaches tend to be brute-force and heavily tailored to specific datasets with little comparison to existing benchmarks or publicly available studies. This article presents a generic, content-agnostic viewport prediction method consisting of a window-based approach combined with a preprocessing system to classify behavioural patterns in terms of user clustering and trajectory correlation. Moreover, as the state of the art does not provide a comparative analysis of different approaches, this work contributes to this. Based on the obtained results, a combined prediction model is proposed and evaluated. Our method shows a 36.8% to 53.9% improvement when compared to the static prediction baseline for a prediction horizon of 8 seconds. In addition, a 11.5% to 24.0% improvement to a brute-force machine learning prediction approach is obtained. As such, this work contributes towards the creation of more generic and structured solutions for content-agnostic viewport prediction in terms of data representation, preprocessing and modelling."}
