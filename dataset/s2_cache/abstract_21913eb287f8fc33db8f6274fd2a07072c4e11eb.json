{"abstract":"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a series of competent graph learning methods for diverse real-world scenarios, ranging from daily applications such as recommendation systems and question answering to cutting-edge technologies such as drug discovery in life sciences and n-body simulation in astrophysics. However, task performance is not the only requirement for GNNs. Performance-oriented GNNs have exhibited potential adverse effects, such as vulnerability to adversarial attacks, unexplainable discrimination against disadvantaged groups, or excessive resource consumption in edge computing environments. To avoid these unintentional harms, it is necessary to build competent GNNs characterized by trustworthiness. To this end, we propose a comprehensive roadmap to build trustworthy GNNs from the view of the various computing technologies involved. In this survey, we introduce basic concepts and comprehensively summarize existing efforts for trustworthy GNNs from six aspects, including robustness, explainability, privacy, fairness, accountability, and environmental well-being. In addition, we highlight the intricate cross-aspect relations between the above six aspects of trustworthy GNNs. Finally, we present a thorough overview of trending directions for facilitating the research and industrialization of trustworthy GNNs."}
