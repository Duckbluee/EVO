{"abstract":"Recent diffusion-based generators can produce high-quality images from textual prompts. However, they often disregard textual instructions that specify the spatial layout of the composition. We propose a simple approach that achieves robust layout control without the need for training or fine-tuning of the image generator. Our technique manipulates the cross-attention layers that the model uses to interface textual and visual information and steers the generation in the desired direction given, e.g., a user-specified layout. To determine how to best guide attention, we study the role of attention maps and explore two alternative strategies, forward and backward guidance. We thoroughly evaluate our approach on three benchmarks and provide several qualitative examples and a comparative analysis of the two strategies that demonstrate the superiority of backward guidance compared to forward guidance, as well as prior work. We further demonstrate the versatility of layout guidance by extending it to applications such as editing the layout and context of real images."}
