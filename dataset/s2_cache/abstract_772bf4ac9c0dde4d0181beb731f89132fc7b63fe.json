{"abstract":"Multimodal signals are powerful for emotion recognition since they can represent emotions comprehensively. In this article, we compare the recognition performance and robustness of two multimodal emotion recognition models: 1) deep canonical correlation analysis (DCCA) and 2) bimodal deep autoencoder (BDAE). The contributions of this article are threefold: 1) we propose two methods for extending the original DCCA model for multimodal fusion: a) weighted sum fusion and b) attention-based fusion; 2) we systemically compare the performance of DCCA, BDAE, and traditional approaches on five multimodal data sets; and 3) we investigate the robustness of DCCA, BDAE, and traditional approaches on SEED-V and DREAMER data sets under two conditions: 1) adding noises to multimodal features and 2) replacing electroencephalography features with noises. Our experimental results demonstrate that DCCA achieves state-of-the-art recognition results on all five data sets: 1) 94.6% on the SEED data set; 2) 87.5% on the SEED-IV data set; 3) 84.3% and 85.6% on the DEAP data set; 4) 85.3% on the SEED-V data set; and 5) 89.0%, 90.6%, and 90.7% on the DREAMER data set. Meanwhile, DCCA has greater robustness when adding various amounts of noises to the SEED-V and DREAMER data sets. By visualizing features before and after DCCA transformation on the SEED-V data set, we find that the transformed features are more homogeneous and discriminative across emotions."}
