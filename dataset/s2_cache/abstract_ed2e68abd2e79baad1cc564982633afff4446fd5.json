{"abstract":"We increasingly depend on a variety of data-driven algorithmic systems to assist us in many aspects of life. Search engines and recommender systems among others are used as sources of information and to help us in making all sort of decisions from selecting restaurants and books, to choosing friends and careers. This has given rise to important concerns regarding the fairness of such systems. In this work, we aim at presenting a toolkit of definitions, models and methods used for ensuring fairness in rankings and recommendations. Our objectives are threefold: (a) to provide a solid framework on a novel, quickly evolving and impactful domain, (b) to present related methods and put them into perspective and (c) to highlight open challenges and research paths for future work."}
