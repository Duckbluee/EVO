{"abstract":"In response to a growing need for small-scale geographic information in various research areas, data-collecting institutions are increasingly georeferencing individual-level data. However, due to confidentiality concerns, external researchers typically have very limited access to these data if at all, resulting in a substantial loss of informational value. A growing body of literature on data protection strategies for geocoded data attempts to find solutions for the tradeoff between privacy protection and utility preservation of the individual-level data. The purpose of this paper is to systematically collect and review the literature in the field and to offer a classification of existing methods. Various strategies for estimating the utility and the remaining risk of disclosure for the protected data are also discussed."}
