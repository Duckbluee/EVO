{"abstract":"Machine learning (ML) has gained widespread adoption in a variety of fields, including computer vision and natural language processing. However, ML models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which can infer whether access data was used in training a target model, thus compromising the privacy of training data. This has led researchers to focus on protecting the privacy of ML. To date, although there have been extensive efforts to defend against MIAs, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the progress made in this area, which can often impede our ability to design the most effective defense strategies. In this article, we aim to fill this critical knowledge gap by providing a systematic analysis of membership inference defense. Specifically, we classify and summarize the existing membership inference defense schemes, focusing on optimization phase and objective, basic intuition, and key technology, and we discuss possible research directions of membership inference defense in the future."}
