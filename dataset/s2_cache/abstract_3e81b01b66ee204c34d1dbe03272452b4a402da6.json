{"abstract":"Control synthesis from temporal logic specifications has gained popularity in recent years. In this paper, we use a model predictive approach to control discrete time linear systems with additive bounded disturbances subject to constraints given as formulas of signal temporal logic (STL). We introduce a (conservative) computationally efficient framework to synthesize control strategies based on mixed integer programs. The designed controllers satisfy the temporal logic requirements, are robust to all possible realizations of the disturbances, and optimal with respect to a cost function. In case the temporal logic constraint is infeasible, the controller satisfies a relaxed, minimally violating constraint. An illustrative case study is included."}
