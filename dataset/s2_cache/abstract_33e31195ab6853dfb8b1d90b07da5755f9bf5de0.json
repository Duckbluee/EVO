{"abstract":"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful machine learning models for various graph learning tasks. Recently, the limitations of the expressive power of various GNN models have been revealed. For example, GNNs cannot distinguish some non-isomorphic graphs and they cannot learn efficient graph algorithms, and several GNN models have been proposed to overcome these limitations. In this paper, we demonstrate that GNNs become powerful just by adding a random feature to each node. We prove that the random features enable GNNs to learn almost optimal polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the minimum dominating set problem and maximum matching problem in terms of the approximation ratio. The main advantage of our method is that it can be combined with off-the-shelf GNN models with slight modifications. Through experiments, we show that the addition of random features enables GNNs to solve various problems that normal GNNs, including GCNs and GINs, cannot solve."}
