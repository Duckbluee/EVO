{"abstract":"Recent advances in relation extraction with deep neural architectures have achieved excellent performance. However, current models still suffer from two main drawbacks: 1) they require enormous volumes of training data to avoid model overfitting and 2) there is a sharp decrease in performance when the data distribution during training and testing shift from one domain to the other. It is thus vital to reduce the data requirement in training and explicitly model the distribution difference when transferring knowledge from one domain to another. In this work, we concentrate on few-shot relation extraction under domain adaptation settings. Specifically, we propose DUAL GRAPH, a novel graph neural network (GNN) based approach for few-shot relation extraction. DUAL GRAPH leverages an edge-labeling dual graph (i.e., an instance graph and a distribution graph) to explicitly model the intraclass similarity and interclass dissimilarity in each individual graph, as well as the instance-level and distribution-level relations across graphs. A dual graph interaction mechanism is proposed to adequately fuse the information between the two graphs in a cyclic flow manner. We extensively evaluate DUAL GRAPH on FewRel1.0 and FewRel2.0 benchmarks under four few-shot configurations. The experimental results demonstrate that DUAL GRAPH can match or outperform previously published approaches. We also perform experiments to further investigate the parameter settings and architectural choices, and we offer a qualitative analysis."}
