{"abstract":". Personal data is becoming one of the most essential resources in today’s information-based society. Accordingly, there is a growing interest in data markets, which operate data trading services between data providers and data consumers. One issue the data markets have to ad-dress is that of the potential threats to privacy. Usually some kind of protection must be provided, which generally comes to the detriment of utility. A correct pricing mechanism for private data should therefore depend on the level of privacy. In this paper, we propose a model of data federation in which data providers, who are, generally, less inﬂuential on the market than data consumers, form a coalition for trading their data, simultaneously shielding against privacy threats by means of dif-ferential privacy. Additionally, we propose a technique to price private data, and an revenue-distribution mechanism to distribute the revenue fairly in such federation data trading environments. Our model also motivates the data providers to cooperate with their respective federations, facilitating a fair and swift private data trading process. We validate our result through various experiments, showing that the proposed methods provide beneﬁts to both data providers and consumers."}
