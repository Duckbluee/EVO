{"abstract":"Due to the increasing popularity of 3D sensors, it has become easier and easier to obtain point cloud data. In many fields such as autonomous driving, how to fully extract the features of point cloud to better understand and perceive 3D scenes requires further research. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end deep learning network for the features of disorder and irregularity of 3D point cloud data. Our network uses an encoder-decoder network architecture, and a three-layer structure is used in both stages. Each encoder layer consists of graph attention convolution and graph attention pooling. Graph attention convolution reflects the spatial distribution relationship in the neighborhood area. And graph attention pooling merges the spatial distribution information in the neighborhood into the feature of the sampling point. The experimental results show that our method achieves the best results in shape classification and has competitive performance in other tasks."}
