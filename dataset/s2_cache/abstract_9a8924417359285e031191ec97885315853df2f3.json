{"abstract":"Ethnic media, which caters to diaspora communities in host nations, serves as a vital platform for these communities to both produce content and access information. Rather than utilizing the language of the host nation, ethnic media delivers news in the language of the immigrant community. For instance, in the USA, Bangla ethnic media presents news in Bangla rather than English. This research delves into the prospective integration of large language models (LLM) and multi-lingual machine translations (MMT) within the ethnic media industry. It centers on the transformative potential of using LLM in MMT in various facets of news translation, searching, and categorization. The paper outlines a theoretical framework elucidating the integration of LLM and MMT into the news searching and translation processes for ethnic media. Additionally, it briefly addresses the potential ethical challenges associated with the incorporation of LLM and MMT in news translation procedures."}
