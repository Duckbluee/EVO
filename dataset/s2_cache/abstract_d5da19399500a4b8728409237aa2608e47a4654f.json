{"abstract":"This paper introduces a method for adapting LoRA adapters in smaller-sized language models to arbitrary downstream tasks. Unlike standard mixture-of-expert architectures, our method employs a gradient-free routing function to choose a weighted combination of experts without increasing the compute requirements for training or inference. The results show that token-level adaptation of LoRA adapters outperforms the base Llama-2-7b model across mathematical (GSM8K), scientific (ARC-Challenge), reading comprehension (SQuAD), and coding (CodeAlpaca-20k) tasks. Further evaluations also show that the average performance of token-level adaptation outperforms individual models fine-tuned for each of the tasks with the best performance observed in the adaptation of every other token during inference. The code for this study is made available through a public repository.1"}
