{"abstract":"Accurate and robust localization is crucial for supporting high-level driving automation and safety. Modern localization solutions rely on various sensors, among which GPS has been and will continue to be essential. However, GPS can be vulnerable to malicious attacks and GPS spoofing has been identified as a high threat. With transportation infrastructure becoming increasingly important in supporting emerging vehicle technologies and systems, this study explores the potential of applying infrastructure data for defending against GPS spoofing. We propose an infrastructure-enabled framework using roadside units as an independent, secured data source. A real-time detector, based on the Isolation Forest, is constructed to detect GPS spoofing. Once spoofing is detected, GPS measurements are isolated, and the potentially compromised location estimator is corrected using secure infrastructure data. We test the proposed method using both simulation and real-world data and show its effectiveness in defending against various GPS spoofing attacks, including stealthy attacks that are proposed to fail the production-grade autonomous driving systems."}
