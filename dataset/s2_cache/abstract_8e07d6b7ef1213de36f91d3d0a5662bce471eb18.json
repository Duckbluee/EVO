{"abstract":"In social network analysis, community detection is a basic step to understand the structure, function and semantics of networks. Some conventional community detection methods may have limited performance because they merely focus on topological structure of networks. In addition to topology, content information is another significant aspect of social networks. Some state-of-the-art methods started to combine these two aspects of information, but they often assume that topology and content share the same characteristics. However, for some examples of social networks, content may mismatch with topological structure. In order to better cope with such situations, we introduce a novel community detection method under the framework of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Our proposed method integrates topology and content of networks, and introduces a novel adaptive parameter for controlling the contribution of content with respect to the identified mismatch degree between the topological and content information. The case study using real social networks show that our new method can simultaneously obtain community partition and the corresponding semantic descriptions. Experiments on both artificial networks and real social networks further indicate that our method outperforms some state-of-the-art methods while exhibiting more robust behaviour when the mismatch topological and content information is observed."}
