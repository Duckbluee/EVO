{"abstract":"As societal concerns on data privacy recently increase, we have witnessed data silos among multiple parties in various applications. Federated learning emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing their raw data. Vertical federated learning, where each party owns different features of the same set of samples and only a single party has the label, is an important and challenging topic in federated learning. Communication costs among different parties have been a major hurdle for practical vertical learning systems. In this paper, we propose a novel communication-efficient vertical federated learning algorithm named FedOnce, which requires only one-shot communication among parties. To improve model accuracy and provide privacy guarantee, FedOnce features unsupervised learning representations in the federated setting and privacy-preserving techniques based on moments accountant. The comprehensive experiments on 10 datasets demonstrate that FedOnce achieves close performance compared to state-of-the-art vertical federated learning algorithms with much lower communication costs. Meanwhile, our privacy-preserving technique significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches under the same privacy budget."}
