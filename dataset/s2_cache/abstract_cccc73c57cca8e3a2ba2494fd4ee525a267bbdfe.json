{"abstract":"To exploit the wealth of data generated and located at distributed entities such as mobile phones, a revolutionary decentralized machine learning setting, known as federated learning, enables multiple clients to collaboratively learn a machine learning model while keeping all their data on-device. However, the scale and decentralization of federated learning present new challenges. Communication between the clients and the server is considered a main bottleneck in the convergence time of federated learning because of a very large number of model’s weights that need to be exchanged in each training round. In this paper, we propose and study Adaptive Federated Dropout (AFD), a novel technique to reduce the communication costs associated with federated learning. It optimizes both server-client communications and computation costs by allowing clients to train locally on a selected subset of the global model. We empirically show that this strategy, combined with existing compression methods, collectively provides up to 57× reduction in convergence time. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions for communication efficiency. Furthermore, it improves model generalization by up to 1.7%."}
