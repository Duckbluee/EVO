{"abstract":"In recent years, the prevalent online services generate a sheer volume of user activity data. Service providers collect these data in order to perform client behavior analysis, and offer better and more customized services. Majority of these data can be modeled and stored as graph, such as the social graph in Facebook, user-video interaction graph in Youtube. These graphs need to evolve over time to capture the dynamics in the real world, leading to the invention of dynamic graphs. However, the temporal information embedded in the dynamic graphs brings new challenges in analyzing and deploying them. Events staleness, temporal information learning and explicit time dimension usage are some example challenges in dynamic graph learning. In order to offer a convenient reference to both the industry and academia, this survey presents the Three Stages Recurrent Temporal Learning Framework based on dynamic graph evolution theories, so as to interpret the learning of temporal information with a generalized framework. Under this framework, this survey categories and reviews different learnable encoder-decoder architectures for supervised dynamic graph learning. We believe that this survey could supply useful guidelines to researchers and engineers in finding suitable graph structures for their dynamic learning tasks."}
