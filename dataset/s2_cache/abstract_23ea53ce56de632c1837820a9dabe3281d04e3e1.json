{"abstract":"Named entity recognition (NER) is a crucial component of various natural language processing (NLP) applications, particularly in healthcare. It involves accurately identifying and extracting named entities such as medical terms, diseases, and drug names, and healthcare professionals are essential for tasks like clinical text analysis, electronic health record management, and medical research. However, healthcare NER faces challenges, especially in Malay, in which specialized corpora are limited, and no general corpus is available yet. To address this, the paper proposes a method for constructing an annotated corpus of Malay health documents. The researchers leverage a parallel source that contains annotated entities in English due to the limited tools available for the Malay language, and it is very language-dependent. Additional credible Malay documents are incorporated as sources to enhance the development. The targeted health entities in this research include penyakit (diseases), simptom (symptoms), and rawatan (treatments). The primary objective is to facilitate the development of NER algorithms specifically tailored to the healthcare domain in the Malay language. The methodology encompasses data collection, preprocessing, annotation of text in both English and Malay, and corpus creation. The outcome of this research is the establishment of the Malay Health Document Annotated Corpus, which serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating NLP models in the Malay language. Future research directions may focus on developing domain-specific NER models, exploring alternative algorithms, and enhancing performance. Overall, this research aims to address the challenges of healthcare NER in the Malay language by constructing an annotated corpus and facilitating the development of tailored NER algorithms for the healthcare domain."}
