{"abstract":"Semantic segmentation labels are expensive and time consuming to acquire. To improve label efficiency of semantic segmentation models, we revisit denoising autoencoders and study the use of a denoising objective for pretraining UNets. We pretrain a Transformer-based UNet as a denoising autoencoder, followed by fine-tuning on semantic segmentation using few labeled examples. Denoising pretraining outperforms training from random initialization, and even supervised ImageNet-21K pretraining of the encoder when the number of labeled images is small. A key advantage of denoising pretraining over supervised pretraining of the backbone is the ability to pretrain the decoder, which would otherwise be randomly initialized. We thus propose a novel Decoder Denoising Pretraining (DDeP) method, in which we initialize the encoder using supervised learning and pretrain only the decoder using the denoising objective. Despite its simplicity, DDeP achieves state-of-the-art results on label-efficient semantic segmentation, offering considerable gains on the Cityscapes, Pascal Context, and ADE20K datasets."}
