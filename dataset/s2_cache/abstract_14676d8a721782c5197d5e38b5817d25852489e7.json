{"abstract":"The influence of class orderings in the evaluation of incremental learning has received very little attention. In this paper, we investigate the impact of class orderings for incrementally learned classifiers. We propose a method to compute various orderings for a dataset. The orderings are derived by simulated annealing optimization from the confusion matrix and reflect different incremental learning scenarios, including maximally and minimally confusing tasks. We evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art incremental learning methods on the proposed orderings. Results show that orderings can have a significant impact on performance and the ranking of the methods."}
