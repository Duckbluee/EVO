{"abstract":"Recently, regression analysis has become a popular tool for face recognition. Most existing regression methods use the one-dimensional, pixel-based error model, which characterizes the representation error individually, pixel by pixel, and thus neglects the two-dimensional structure of the error image. We observe that occlusion and illumination changes generally lead, approximately, to a low-rank error image. In order to make use of this low-rank structural information, this paper presents a two-dimensional image-matrix-based error model, namely, nuclear norm based matrix regression (NMR), for face representation and classification. NMR uses the minimal nuclear norm of representation error image as a criterion, and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to calculate the regression coefficients. We further develop a fast ADMM algorithm to solve the approximate NMR model and show it has a quadratic rate of convergence. We experiment using five popular face image databases: the Extended Yale B, AR, EURECOM, Multi-PIE and FRGC. Experimental results demonstrate the performance advantage of NMR over the state-of-the-art regression-based methods for face recognition in the presence of occlusion and illumination variations."}
