{"abstract":"Gait recognition has proven to be effective for long-distance human recognition. But view variance of gait features would change human appearance greatly and reduce its performance. Most existing gait datasets usually collect data with a dozen different angles, or even more few. Limited view angles would prevent learning better view invariant feature. It can further improve robustness of gait recognition if we collect data with various angles at 1° interval. But it is time consuming and labor consuming to collect this kind of dataset. In this paper, we, therefore, introduce a Dense-View GEIs Set (DV-GEIs) to deal with the challenge of limited view angles. This set can cover the whole view space, view angle from 0° to 180° with 1° interval. In addition, Dense-View GAN (DV-GAN) is proposed to synthesize this dense view set. DV-GAN consists of Generator, Discriminator and Monitor, where Monitor is designed to preserve human identification and view information. The proposed method is evaluated on the CASIA-B and OU-ISIR dataset. The experimental results show that DV-GEIs synthesized by DV-GAN is an effective way to learn better view invariant feature. We believe the idea of dense view generated samples will further improve the development of gait recognition."}
