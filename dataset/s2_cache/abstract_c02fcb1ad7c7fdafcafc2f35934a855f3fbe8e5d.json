{"abstract":"Although automated image captioning meth-001 ods have benefited considerably from the de-002 velopment of large language models (LLMs), 003 generating humorous captions is still a chal-004 lenging task. Humorous captions generated 005 by humans are unique to the image and re-006 flect the content of the image. However, cap-007 tions generated using previous captioning mod-008 els tend to be generic. Therefore, we pro-009 pose incongruity-resolution chain-of-thought 010 (IRCoT) as a novel prompting framework that 011 creates content-specific resolutions from fine 012 details extracted from an image. Furthermore, 013 we integrate logit bias and negative sampling to 014 suppress the output of generic resolutions. The 015 results of experiments with GPT4-V demon-016 strate that our proposed framework effectively 017 generated humorous captions tailored to the 018 content of specific input images. 019"}
