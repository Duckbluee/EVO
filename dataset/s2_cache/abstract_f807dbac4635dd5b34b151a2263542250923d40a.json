{"abstract":"A key impediment to the use of AI is the lacking of transparency, especially in safety/security critical applications. The black-box nature of AI systems prevents humans from direct explanations on how the AI makes predictions, which stimulated Explainable AI (XAI) -- a research field that aims at improving the trust and transparency of AI systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel XAI technique, BayLIME, which is a Bayesian modification of the widely used XAI approach LIME. BayLIME exploits prior knowledge to improve the consistency in repeated explanations of a single prediction and also the robustness to kernel settings. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments are conducted to support our conclusions."}
