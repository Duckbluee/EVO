{"abstract":"Testing with quiz questions has proven to be an effective way to assess and improve the educational process. However, manually creating quizzes is tedious and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we present Leaf, a system for generating multiple-choice questions from factual text. In addition to being very well suited for the classroom, Leaf could also be used in an industrial setting, e.g., to facilitate onboarding and knowledge sharing, or as a component of chatbots, question answering systems, or Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The code and the demo are available on https://github.com/KristiyanVachev/Leaf-Question-Generation."}
