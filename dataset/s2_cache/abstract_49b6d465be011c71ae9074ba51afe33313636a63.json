{"abstract":"Existing video anomaly detection methods typically utilize reconstruction or prediction error to detect anomalies in the current frame. However, these methods cannot predict ex-ante potential anomalies in future frames, which is imperative in real scenes. Inspired by the ex-ante prediction ability of humans, we propose an unsupervised Ex-ante Potential Anomaly Prediction Network (EPAP-Net), which learns to build a semantic pool to memorize the normal semantic patterns of future frames for indirect anomaly prediction. At the training time, the memorized patterns are encouraged to be discriminated through our Semantic Pool Building Module (SPBM) with the novel padding and updating strategies. Moreover, we present a novel Semantic Similarity Loss (SSLoss) at the feature level to maximize the semantic consistency of memorized items and corresponding future frames. Specially, to enhance the value of our work, we design a Multiple Frames Prediction module (MFP) to achieve anomaly prediction in future multiple frames. At the test time, we utilize the trained semantic pool instead of ground truth to evaluate the anomalies of future frames. Besides, to obtain better feature representations for our task, we introduce a novel Channel-selected Shift Encoder (CSE), which shifts channels along the temporal dimension between the input frames to capture motion information without generating redundant features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EPAP-Net can effectively predict the potential anomalies in future frames and exhibit superior or competitive performance on video anomaly detection."}
