{"abstract":"This paper introduces a novel run-time testing, analysis, and code optimization (TACO) method for quantum neural network (QNN) software in advanced Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems, which visually presents the learning performance that is called a barren plateau. The run-time visual presentation of barren plateau situations is helpful for real-time quantum-based advanced IoT software testing because the software engineers can easily be aware of the training performances of QNN. Moreover, this tool is obviously useful for software engineers because it can intuitively guide them in designing and implementing high-accurate QNN-based advanced IoT software even if they are not familiar with quantum mechanics and quantum computing. Lastly, the proposed TACO is also capable of visual feedback because software engineers visually identify the barren plateau situations using tensorboard. In turn, they are also able to modify QNN structures based on the information."}
