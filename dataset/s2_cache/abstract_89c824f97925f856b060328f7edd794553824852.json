{"abstract":"We develop a fused matrix multiplication kernel that unifies sampled dense-dense matrix multiplication and sparsedense matrix multiplication under a single operation called FusedMM. By using user-defined functions, FusedMM can capture almost all computational patterns needed by popular graph embedding and GNN approaches.FusedMM is an order of magnitude faster than its equivalent kernels in Deep Graph Library. The superior performance of FusedMM comes from the low-level vectorized kernels, a suitable load balancing scheme and an efficient utilization of the memory bandwidth. FusedMM can tune its performance using a code generator and perform equally well on Intel, AMD and ARM processors. FusedMM speeds up an end-to-end graph embedding algorithm by up to $28 \\times$ on different processors. The source code is available at https://github.com/HipGraph/FusedMM."}
