{"abstract":"The capability of recognizing pedestrian attributes, such as gender and clothing style, at far distance, is of practical interest in far-view surveillance scenarios where face and body close-shots are hardly available. We make two contributions in this paper. First, we release a new pedestrian attribute dataset, which is by far the largest and most diverse of its kind. We show that the large-scale dataset facilitates the learning of robust attribute detectors with good generalization performance. Second, we present the benchmark performance by SVM-based method and propose an alternative approach that exploits context of neighboring pedestrian images for improved attribute inference."}
