{"abstract":"Recommender systems help people find relevant content in a personalized way. One main promise of such systems is that they are able to increase the visibility of items in the long tail, i.e., the lesser-known items in a catalogue. Existing research, however, suggests that in many situations today’s recommendation algorithms instead exhibit a popularity bias, meaning that they often focus on rather popular items in their recommendations. Such a bias may not only lead to the limited value of the recommendations for consumers and providers in the short run, but it may also cause undesired reinforcement effects over time. In this paper, we discuss the potential reasons for popularity bias and review existing approaches to detect, quantify and mitigate popularity bias in recommender systems. Our survey, therefore, includes both an overview of the computational metrics used in the literature as well as a review of the main technical approaches to reduce the bias. Furthermore, we critically discuss today’s literature, where we observe that the research is almost entirely based on computational experiments and on certain assumptions regarding the practical effects of including long-tail items in the recommendations."}
