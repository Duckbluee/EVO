{"abstract":"The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) in combination with easy-to-use interfaces such as ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Google’s Bard represent both a Herculean task and a sublime opportunity for Business and Information Systems Engineering. The technology and its applications already have considerable impact in many domains directly related to the design, operation, and application of information systems. In this editorial, we seek to explore this new reality as researchers, practitioners, and legislators will – in some form or another – have to deal with it. Our goal is to provide insights and encourage research in this new, exciting, and rapidly developing field."}
