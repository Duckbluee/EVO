{"abstract":"When engaging in strategic decision-making, we are frequently confronted with overwhelming information and data. The situation can be further complicated when certain pieces of evidence contradict each other or become paradoxical. The primary challenge is how to determine which information can be trusted when we adopt Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for decision-making. This issue is known as deciding what to decide or Trustworthy AI. However, the AI system itself is often considered an opaque black box. We propose a new approach to address this issue by introducing a novel framework of Trustworthy AI (TAI) encompassing three crucial components of AI: representation space, loss function, and optimizer. Each component is loosely coupled with four TAI properties. Altogether, the framework consists of twelve TAI properties. We aim to use this framework to conduct the TAI experiments by quantitive and qualitative research methods to satisfy TAI properties for the decision-making context. The framework allows us to formulate an optimal prediction model trained by the given dataset for applying the strategic investment decision of credit default swaps (CDS) in the technology sector. Finally, we provide our view of the future direction of TAI research"}
