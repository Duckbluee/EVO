{"abstract":"Mobile phones are a pervasive platform for opportunistic sensing of behaviors and opinions. Three studies use location and communication sensors to model individual behaviors and symptoms, long-term health outcomes, and the diffusion of opinions in a community. These three analyses illustrate how mobile phones can unobtrusively monitor rich social interactions, because the underlying sensing technologies are now commonplace and readily available."}
