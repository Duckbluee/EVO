{"abstract":"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attraction due to their expansive real-world applications. To build trustworthy GNNs, two aspects - fairness and privacy - have emerged as critical considerations. Previous studies have separately examined the fairness and privacy aspects of GNNs, revealing their tradeoff with GNN performance. Yet, the inter-play between these two aspects remains unexplored. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of the interaction between the privacy risks of edge leakage and the individual fairness of a GNN. Our theoretical analysis unravels that edge privacy risks unfortunately escalate when the nodes' individual fairness improves. Such an issue hinders the accomplishment of privacy and fairness of GNNs at the same time. To balance fairness and privacy, we carefully introduce fairness-aware loss reweighting based on in-fluence function and privacy-aware graph structure perturbation modules within a fine-tuning mechanism. Experimental results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in achieving GNN fairness with limited performance compromise and controlled privacy risks. This work contributes to the comprehensively developing trustworthy GNNs by simultaneously addressing both fairness and privacy aspects."}
