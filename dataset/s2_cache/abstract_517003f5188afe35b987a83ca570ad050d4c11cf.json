{"abstract":"Achieving ultra-high reliability for short packets is a core challenge for future wireless communication systems, as current systems are designed only to transmit long packets based on classical information-theoretic principles. To tackle this challenge, this letter relies on multi-hop unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relay links to deliver short ultra-reliable and low-latency (URLLC) instruction packets between ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To accomplish this task, we perform non-linear optimization to minimize the overall decoding error probability in order to find the optimal values of the distance and the blocklength. In this vein, a novel, semi-empirical based non-iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the quasi-optimization problem. The algorithm executes in quasilinear time and converges to a globally optimal/sub-optimal solution based on the chosen parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm allows operation under the ultra-reliable regime (URR), and yields the same performance as exhaustive search algorithms."}
