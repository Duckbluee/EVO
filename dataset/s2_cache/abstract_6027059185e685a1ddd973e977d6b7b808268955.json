{"abstract":"We introduce a new generative system called Edit Everything, which can take image and text inputs and produce image outputs. Edit Everything allows users to edit images using simple text instructions. Our system designs prompts to guide the visual module in generating requested images. Experiments demonstrate that Edit Everything facilitates the implementation of the visual aspects of Stable Diffusion with the use of Segment Anything model and CLIP. Our system is publicly available at https://github.com/DefengXie/Edit_Everything."}
