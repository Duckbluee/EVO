{"abstract":"During the recent years, the issue of preserving the integrity of digital text has become a focus of interest in the transmission of online content on the Internet. Watermarking has a useful tool in the protection of digital text content as it solves the problem of tampering, duplicating, unauthorized access, and security breaches. The rapid development currently observable in information transfer and access is the consequences of the widespread usage of the Internet. When it comes to the different types of digital data, text constitutes the most complex and challenging type to which the method of text watermarking can be applied. Text watermarking constitutes a highly complex task, most of all, since only limited research has been done in this field. In order to ensure the successful evaluation, analysis, and implementation, a comprehensive research needs to be performed. This paper studies the theory, methods, and applications of text watermarking, which includes the discussion on the definition, embedding and extracting processes, requirements, approaches, and language applications of the established text watermarking methods. This paper reviews in detail the new classification of text watermarking, which is through embedding process and its related issues of attacks and language applicability. Open research challenges and future directions are also investigated, with a focus on its information integrity, information availability, originality preservation, information confidentiality, protection of sensitive information, document transformation, cryptography application, and language flexibility."}
