{"abstract":"Effective training of the deep neural networks requires much data to avoid underdetermined and poor generalization. Data Augmentation alleviates this by using existing data more effectively. However standard data augmentation produces only limited plausible alternative data by for example, flipping, distorting, adding noise to, cropping a patch from the original samples. In this paper, we introduce the adversarial autoencoder (AAE) to impose the feature representations with uniform distribution and apply the linear interpolation on latent space, which is potential to generate a much broader set of augmentations for image classification. As a possible “recognition via generation” framework, it has potentials for several other classification tasks. Our experiments on the ILSVRC 2012, CIFAR-10 datasets show that the latent space interpolation (LSI) improves the generalization and performance of state-of-the-art deep neural networks."}
