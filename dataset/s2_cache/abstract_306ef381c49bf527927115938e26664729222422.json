{"abstract":"For many years, link prediction on knowledge. graphs has been a purely transductive task, not allowing for reasoning on unseen entities. \n\nRecently, increasing efforts are put into exploring semi- and fully inductive scenarios, enabling inference over unseen and emerging entities.\n\nStill, all these approaches only consider triple-based KGs, whereas their richer counterparts, hyper-relational KGs (e.g., Wikidata), have not yet been properly studied.\n\nIn this work, we classify different inductive settings and study the benefits of employing hyper-relational KGs on a wide range of semi- and fully inductive link prediction tasks powered by recent advancements in graph neural networks. \n\nOur experiments on a novel set of benchmarks show that qualifiers over typed edges can lead to performance improvements of 6% of absolute gains (for the Hits@10 metric) compared to triple-only baselines. \n\nOur code is available at https://github.com/mali-git/hyper_relational_ilp."}
