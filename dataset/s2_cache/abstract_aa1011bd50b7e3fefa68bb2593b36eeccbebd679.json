{"abstract":"Can we combine heterogenous graph structure with text to learn high-quality semantic and behavioural representations? Graph neural networks (GNN)s encode numerical node attributes and graph structure to achieve impressive performance in a variety of supervised learning tasks. Current GNN approaches are challenged by textual features, which typically need to be encoded to a numerical vector before provided to the GNN that may incur some information loss. In this paper, we put forth an efficient and effective framework termed language model GNN (LM-GNN) to jointly train large-scale language models and graph neural networks. The effectiveness in our framework is achieved by applying stage-wise fine-tuning of the BERT model first with heterogenous graph information and then with a GNN model. Several system and design optimizations are proposed to enable scalable and efficient training. LM-GNN accommodates node and edge classification as well as link prediction tasks. We evaluate the LM-GNN framework in different datasets performance and showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach. LM-GNN provides competitive results in an Amazon query-purchase-product application."}
