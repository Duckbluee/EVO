{"abstract":"Artificial intelligence research in the \nstock market sector has been heavily geared towards stock price prediction \nrather than stock price manipulation. As online trading systems have increased \nthe amount of high volume and re-al-time data transactions, the stock market \nhas increased vulnerability to at-tacks. This paper aims to detect these \nattacks based on normal trade behavior using an Artificial Immune System (AIS) \napproach combined with one of four clustering algorithms. The AIS approach is \ninspired by its proven ability to handle time-series data and its ability to \ndetect abnormal behavior while only being trained on regular trade behavior. \nThese two main points are essential as the models need to adapt over time to \nadjust to normal trade behavior as it evolves, and due to confidentiality and \ndata restrictions, real-world manipula-tions are not available for training. \nThis paper discovers a competitive alterna-tive to the leading approach and \ninvestigates the effects of combining AIS with clustering algorithms; Kernel \nDensity Estimation, Self-Organized Maps, Densi-ty-Based Spatial Clustering of \nApplications with Noise and Spectral clustering. The best performing solution \nachieves leading performance using common clustering metrics, including Area \nUnder the Curve, False Alarm Rate, False Negative Rate, and Computation Time."}
