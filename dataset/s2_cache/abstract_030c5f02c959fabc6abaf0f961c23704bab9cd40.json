{"abstract":"Deep Reinforcement Learning has led us to newer possibilities in solving complex control and navigation related tasks. The paper presents Deep Reinforcement Learning autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance of self-driving cars, applied with Deep Q Network to a simulated car an urban environment. The approach uses two types of sensor data as input: camera sensor and laser sensor in front of the car. It also designs a cost-efficient high-speed car prototype capable of running the same algorithm in real-time. The design uses a camera and a Hokuyo Lidar sensor in the car front. It uses embedded GPU (Nvidia-TX2) for running deep-learning algorithms based on sensor inputs."}
