{"abstract":"Machine learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various fields, from image classification to speech recognition. However, such models are trained with a large amount of sensitive training data, and are typically computationally expensive to build. As a result, many cloud providers (e.g., Google) have launched machine-learning-as-a-service, which helps clients benefit from the sophisticated cloud-based machine learning models via accessing public APIs. Such a business paradigm significantly expedites and simplifies the development circles. Unfortunately, the commercial value of such cloud-based machine learning models motivates attackers to conduct model extraction attacks for free use or as a springboard to conduct other attacks (e.g., craft adversarial examples in black-box settings). In this article, we conduct a thorough investigation of existing approaches to model extraction attacks and defenses on cloud-based models. We classify the state-of-the-art attack schemes into two categories based on whether the attacker aims to steal the property (i.e., parameters, hyperparameters, and architecture) or the functionality of the model. We also categorize defending schemes into two groups based on whether the scheme relies on output disturbance or query observation. We not only present a detailed survey of each method, but also demonstrate the comparison of both attack and defense approaches via experiments. We highlight several future directions in both model extraction attacks and its defenses, which shed light on possible avenues for further studies."}
