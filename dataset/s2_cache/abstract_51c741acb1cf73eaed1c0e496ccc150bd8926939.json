{"abstract":"In this review the application of deep learning for medical diagnosis is addressed. A thorough analysis of various scientific articles in the domain of deep neural networks application in the medical field has been conducted. More than 300 research articles were obtained, and after several selection steps, 46 articles were presented in more detail. The results indicate that convolutional neural networks (CNN) are the most widely represented when it comes to deep learning and medical image analysis. Furthermore, based on the findings of this article, it can be noted that the application of deep learning technology is widespread, but the majority of applications are focused on bioinformatics, medical diagnosis and other similar fields."}
