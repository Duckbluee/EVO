Task:
Extract Methodology Taxonomy from a Survey/Review Paper and output a Section-organized hierarchical JSON.

Input:
You will receive a survey/review paper (PDF or extracted text).

Objective:

Extract ONLY methodology/technical classification sections.

Construct full section hierarchy.

Attach references appearing within each section.

Organize output by Section-first structure.

Do NOT organize by paper globally.

Required Output Structure:

{
"survey_title": "...",
"taxonomy_tree": [...],
"reference_index": {...}
}

Each Section node must be:

{
"label": "3.2 Graph-based Methods",
"path": ["3 Methods", "3.2 Graph-based Methods"],
"children": [...],
"papers": [...]
}

Rules:

label must preserve original numbering and title.

path must contain full hierarchy from methodology root.

children must contain nested subsections.

papers must contain references appearing within that section.

Citation Handling:

Case 1: Numeric citations
Examples: [12], [3,5,7], [8–10]

Rules:

Use original number as ref_id.

Expand ranges.

Record each reference separately.

Assign to the most fine-grained section node.

Case 2: Author-Year citations
Examples: (Smith, 2020), Smith et al., 2019

Rules:

Assign ref_id sequentially based on first appearance.

Reuse ref_id for repeated citations.

Reference Parsing Requirements:

For each ref_id extract:

title_raw

title (cleaned and repaired)

year (null if unavailable)

Title Repair Rules:

Fix broken words.

Fix concatenated words.

Do not hallucinate content.

Always preserve title_raw.

If uncertain, keep original.

Methodology Section Filtering:

Include only sections that describe technical taxonomy.

Exclude:

Introduction

Conclusion

Future Work

Acknowledgement

General Background (unless taxonomy included)

Pure Related Work (unless structured taxonomy)

Decision signals:

High citation density.

Contains keywords: method, model, framework, algorithm, taxonomy, category.

Explicit technical classification.

Paper storage format:

{
"ref_id": 12,
"title": "...",
"title_raw": "...",
"year": 2019,
"count": 3
}

Rules:

count = appearances within this section.

Same paper may appear in multiple sections.

Do not merge across sections.

Mandatory reference_index:

"reference_index": {
"12": {
"title": "...",
"title_raw": "...",
"year": 2019
}
}

Forbidden:

Do not organize by paper.

Do not flatten hierarchy.

Do not modify section labels.

Do not hallucinate titles.

Do not output explanations.

Error Handling:

If citation appears but reference missing → year = null.

If mapping fails → keep ref_id.

If title uncertain → preserve raw.

Output:
JSON only.
No explanations.
No markdown.
No extra text.
